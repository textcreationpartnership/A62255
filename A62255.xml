            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving had a more then ordinary inſpection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>PRINCIPLES</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> I have (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account) been earneſtly mov'd by ſome Perſons of Honor, and Worth, to Write ſomething in Oppoſition to that <hi>Church;</hi> and at length I was wrought to a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. In the purſuit whereof, I have had no conſideration of the Unkindneſs and Ingratitude of ſome of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> towards me, but have proceeded with all imaginable Candor and Sincerity, wholly deveſted of all Ranker,
<pb facs="tcp:101117:5"/>Spleen, and Animoſity, againſt their Perſons: But, I deem'd it no way repugnant to <hi>Chriſtian Charity</hi> to uſe my beſt endeavors, to open a way to Truth. And if ſometimes my <hi>Pen</hi> ſeems to be Dipt in <hi>Gall,</hi> yet this only is a product of Zeal for the Doctrine I have undertaken to defend, in oppoſition to theirs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt intending to infringe the Laws of <hi>Morality.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Heads of Doctrine contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in each <hi>Diſputation</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> I have ſeveral times Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Learnedſt <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> that I could meet with (of ſeveral Religious Orders) <hi>quaſi tentando,</hi> by way of Diſcourſe.<note place="margin">P.

<pb facs="tcp:101117:5"/>fidei,</hi> to captivate our <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in Obedience to <hi>Faith.</hi>

            <p>To all theſe I Reply, That <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith</hi> conſiſts of Two parts; the Material Object, which is the thing we Believe, and the Formal Object, which is the Motive why we Believe, and that is <hi>dictio Dei,</hi> God's ſaying, or revealing it. Wherefore, when a Myſtery is propoſed to be Believed as an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Faith,</hi> though I have no Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb facs="tcp:101117:6"/>
               <hi>in atteſtato,</hi> in the thing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, becauſe I cannot demonſtrate the <hi>Truth</hi> of it by <hi>Human Reaſon;</hi> yet if I have Evidence, or Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>in atteſtante,</hi> that is, I am ſure God ſays it; then with a Blind Obedience, and with a firm Adheſion, I aſſent to it: But if it be Doubtful, and Ambiguous, whether it be a <hi>Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or no; then to Institute a ſtrict Inquiry, Whether it be truly and really atteſted by <hi>Divine Autority</hi> or no, is an act of Prudence, and therefore not dangerous, but ſecure and laudable. But how ſhall we know aſſuredly whether it be a <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation</hi> or not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That no New Revelations are to be admitted, but ſuch as are contained in <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> in the <hi>Canonical Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That if the Myſtery propoſed drive us to
<pb facs="tcp:101117:6"/>ſuch Extremities, that no Aſſent can be given to it, without deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome one of the <hi>Prima Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia Lumine Naturae nota,</hi> Firſt Principles known by the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which the Wit of Man cannot avoid, then we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that if it be a new Doctrine not contained in <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> or if it be evidently incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſistent with the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> in both caſes it comes not from God, but is a meer <hi>Human Invention;</hi> And we ought not to Believe by <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> that which is backt only by <hi>Human Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Difficulties of <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> thoſe which are Seeming Contradictions, are moſt <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> and are Solved by thoſe <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> who, <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> have Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo many Large <hi>Tomes</hi> of the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Myſteries, which are Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb facs="tcp:101117:7"/>and Doctrinal, as a <hi>Virgin</hi> to Conceive; the Incarnation of the <hi>Divine Word,</hi> and the <hi>Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union;</hi> the Myſtery of the <hi>Sacred Trinity,</hi> &amp;c. there is no one of all theſe that is deſtructive of the Light of <hi>Human Reaſon,</hi> or that will reduce us to a neceſſity of denying the Truth of any of the Firſt Principles. Since therefore we admit of all <hi>Canonical Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> as the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> we ought to Believe it by <hi>Divine Faith.</hi> For certain it is, that as God's Infinite Veracity is uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of aſſerting ſuch things, as are impoſſible; ſo likewiſe, by the ſame Rule, God (who is the Author of <hi>Human Reaſon</hi>) is uncapable of Impoſing upon Man's Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a neceſſity of Believing that which is falſe, or impoſſible; for if falſe, it is deſtructive of his Veracity, which would un-God
<pb facs="tcp:101117:7"/>him; if Impoſſible, it is inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with <hi>Human Reaſon.</hi> And yet all things are to be granted to the <hi>Divine Omnipotence,</hi> that involve not a manifeſt Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>And this may ſerve as a <hi>Reply</hi> to the <hi>Anſwers</hi> of the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Doctors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore proceed, in order to examine the <hi>Controverted Difficulties,</hi> which this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> contains, as they are digested un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their reſpective <hi>Heads,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of each hath his <hi>Peculiar Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the <hi>Diſputations</hi> I Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divide into <hi>Sections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>Second Diſputation</hi> of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> I have Inſerted moſt of the <hi>Antient Rituals</hi> and <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> of the <hi>Latine, Greek,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſtern Churches,</hi> which <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> Tranſlated out of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Syrian</hi> into <hi>Latine.</hi> And, as
<pb facs="tcp:101117:8"/>this <hi>Tranſlator</hi> was tyed to give the <hi>Literal Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Originals,</hi> without <hi>Mutation;</hi> ſo alſo I deem'd it Illegal to make any change or alteration in the <hi>Latin Verſion,</hi> which in ſome places is obſcure, and obſolete, but I have rendered the true and genuine ſenſe thereof in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to the beſt of my capacity.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the <hi>Pretended In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Foundation and main <hi>Prop,</hi> which ſupports their <hi>Confidence,</hi> Inductive to ſeveral <hi>Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Decrees,</hi> whereby they ſeem to Wage <hi>War</hi> with <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> I deem'd it expedient in the Firſt Place, to Detect the <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of this <hi>Foundation;</hi> but, this being a Negative Deſign, the moſt proportionable means to accompliſh my end, is, to refel the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> which they produce, for
<pb facs="tcp:101117:8"/>the eſtabliſhing this <hi>Non-erring Prerogative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet the Chiefeſt <hi>Argument</hi> they Alleadge, is but a Fallacious <hi>Illuſive Circle;</hi> for, they prove the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of their <hi>Church</hi> by <hi>Scripture,</hi> and prove the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> by the <hi>Infallible Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Qualifying either Part, to prove the other, but Rely upon the Support; that theſe two Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to each other, which, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is to prove neither.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, I Inſiſt not much upon this <hi>Argument,</hi> but mention it, and ſo proceed. I ſhould have Inſtituted a more <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Indagation</hi> and <hi>Refutation</hi> of it, had I not ſeen it ſafely deduc'd, by a more <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Skilful Pen;</hi> and, with that Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that his <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> will ſcarce Attempt another <hi>Conteſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:101117:9"/>with him, in this Particular; for the Wit of Man, though backt with all their <hi>Learning,</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to make it out.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſtrange, how ſuch <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and others alſo, not here Treated of, could be ſo Publickly Introduced into a <hi>Church</hi> of ſo Large an <hi>Extent,</hi> without great <hi>Contention,</hi> and <hi>Inteſtine Broyles;</hi> yea, without the leaſt <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> or <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For it is certain, that they have many amongſt them, who are very Learned, and Able <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,</hi> whoſe Intellects are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently qualified with deep <hi>Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,</hi> and <hi>Perſpicacity,</hi> and yet none <hi>Reclaims,</hi> nor calls thoſe Strange <hi>Dogmatical Points</hi> in
<pb facs="tcp:101117:9"/>Queſtion. The reaſon is, becauſe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Immur'd, and Fenced on all ſides, and hath ſuch variety of Armes, and Weapons, to ſuppreſs her <hi>Opponents,</hi> that ſhe ſeems formidable to all; for, if any one, either by Word, or Writing, ſhould teſtifie any diſlike of her <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> or <hi>Definitions,</hi> he is firſt branded with the Infamous Note of an <hi>Heretick;</hi> and if he do not Recant, the <hi>Church</hi> hath other <hi>Remedies:</hi> next follows <hi>Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion</hi> from his <hi>Prieſtly Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> there are alſo <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Cenſures,</hi> and <hi>Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;</hi> there is <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Major,</hi> and <hi>Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio Minor;</hi> ſome are <hi>Latae Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae,</hi> ſome <hi>Sententiae Feren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dae;</hi> ſome are <hi>à Jure,</hi> others <hi>ab Homine;</hi> ſome are <hi>Reſervatae,</hi> others <hi>non Reſervatae,</hi> whereof
<pb facs="tcp:101117:10"/>there is a Long <hi>Catalogue</hi> in the <hi>Bulla Coenae;</hi> there are alſo <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts</hi> for whole <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;</hi> And which is worſt of all, in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> if the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Mater Eccleſia</hi> be oppoſed by any, there the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> lies gaping for them, and ready to Swallow them up Alive.</p>
            <p>All which ſtrikes the moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious of them into a Pannick Fear; they dread the Puniſhment, and therefore Industriouſly ſhun the Means of Incurring it.</p>
            <p>Hence the Supine Neglect in their <hi>Divines</hi> of <hi>Attempting</hi> to <hi>Reforme,</hi> or prevent ſuch <hi>Errors,</hi> though never ſo Repugnant to their Judgments; for, beſides the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Penalties,</hi> they muſt alſo expect (if they be <hi>Readers</hi>) to be Depoſed from their <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical

            </p>
            <p>And hence that Profound Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their <hi>Popes</hi> and <hi>Councils,</hi> in framing their <hi>Definitions;</hi> for being Conſcious of their Immunity from Oppoſition, they are hence raiſed to a Confidence of Attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, ſince none that are Subject to the <hi>Roman Juriſdiction</hi> have ſo much Reſolution, as to Struggle with the many <hi>Obſtacles</hi> and <hi>Arduity,</hi> as they will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet withal, to Obviate their Deſign, of Oppoſing thoſe <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</hi>

            <p>I have here undertaken to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute</hi> ſome of them; in the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution whereof I have taken a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> far different from that, of

            <p>So that this <hi>Bulwork</hi> (though against them) is raiſed by their own <hi>Labor</hi> and <hi>Induſtry,</hi> and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with <hi>Armes</hi> and <hi>Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition,</hi> drawn from their own <hi>Magazine;</hi> yea, and <hi>Mann'd</hi> by

            </p>
            <p>Hence the <hi>Reader</hi> (if not Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautioned) may take occaſion to deem me a <hi>Defender</hi> of their <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine;</hi> whereas in Reality I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſe it, according to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Diſputation, Ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> to make ſuch Deductions from thence, as are destructive of each particular <hi>Point</hi> of their <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Practiſe,</hi> which I Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne; and this in effect is no other then to pronounce their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction by their own Hands.
<pb facs="tcp:101117:12"/>
               <hi>Perditio tua ex te Iſrael.</hi> For, though many of thoſe <hi>Principles,</hi> (which are the <hi>Ground-Work</hi> of my <hi>Diſcourſe</hi>) are common to both <hi>Churches:</hi> yet others there are, which peculiarly are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>So we all agree in the <hi>Notion</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but differ in the <hi>Number</hi> of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. yet with them, I <hi>Suppoſe</hi> (not <hi>Grant</hi>) <hi>Seven Sacraments;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make it Appear, that they <hi>Tranſgreſs</hi> againſt <hi>Divine Right,</hi> by Changing the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> and by <hi>Invalida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Clandeſtine Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. which they Acknowledge to be both <hi>Sacraments.</hi>

            <p>In the Proſecution whereof, I have confin'd my ſelf to as much Brevity, as is Compatible with the Right <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and True Meaning, of the Reſpective <hi>Points</hi> of <hi>Doctrine</hi> here Treated;

               <p>THE natural and acquiſite knowledge of Man's intellectual Faculty could never pretend to any ſpecifical degree of Clarity, above thoſe obſcure Notions which by foreign Species we draw from ſeveral Objects; wherefore the Repreſentation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weak, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding is ſeldom certainly aſſured of the true State of the Object.

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Wherein conſiſts the true Notion of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility?</head>
               <p>TO the end we may with great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er perſpicuity trace the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in their Principles, we muſt firſt premiſe a four-fold Knowledge that the Underſtanding is capable of: There is an abſtractive, a quidditive, an intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and a comprehenſive Knowledge. The firſt is a weak and imperfect repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, fram'd by borrowed Species, gathered firſt by the external and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Senſes, and thence tranſmitted to the Underſtanding, which are but vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual repreſentations, and as it were the Seeds of the Object, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Vital Power, together with theſe Species, as con-cauſes, produce a formal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101117:14"/>image or repreſentation of the Object: And this abſtractive Knowledge, is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the State of Man in this Life. A quidditive Knowledge is a clearer Repreſentation, framed by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, inſtructed with proper Species, by means whereof it penetrates into the eſſential Perfections and peculiar Faculties of the <hi>Prototypon,</hi> or thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented. An intuitive Knowledge is that which, by the proper Species of the exemplar, diſtinguiſheth in what State the Object is, whither exiſtent, paſt, or to come; and herein it reſembles that Science in God, which the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call <hi>Scientia viſionis.</hi> A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive Knowledge includes the two former; and moreover repreſents all the Perfections, Powers and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of its Object explicitely, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to all its Connotates and Correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, explicating diſtinctly all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of effects that may proceed from ſuch a cauſe, and diſcovering all and ſingular the innate Powers and Faculties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with reference to all external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that have any connexion, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or relation to it. And becauſe theſe external Objects are infinite, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this comprehenſive Knowledge
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101117:15"/>is peculiar to God alone, but the two former are imparted to the Bleſſed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Souls of the Faithful, who by their Beatifical Viſion ſee God quiddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and intuitively.</p>
               <p>Moreover there are three degrees of clarity, or certainty, whereby various Acts of the Underſtanding do variouſly repreſent their Objects. The firſt is Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, which by reaſon of its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imbecillity is always accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a virtual or formal Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and Fear that the contrary may be true, becauſe the motives that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive to the aſſent bring no aſſurance, but only a ſeeming reſemblance with the Truth. The ſecond is a Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, which, though there be a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of its failing, yet ſeldom or never errs; as one that never was at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet hath a Moral certainty that ſuch a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is extant, becauſe he hath often heard the concurring Teſtimonies of ſo many that have been there. The third and higheſt degree is the certainty of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility, which is always accompanied with Truth, and imports alſo an inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of Erring, ſo that all Phyſical, Mathematical, and Metaphyſical demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and all thoſe Truths which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101117:15"/>Philoſophers call <hi>Prima Principia,</hi> as <hi>Nihil poteſt ſimul eſſe &amp; non eſſe. Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne totum eſt majus ſuâ parte. Quae ſunt eadem unitertio ſunt eadem inter ſe,</hi> &amp;c. all theſe are inveſted with the certainty of Infallibility. To this alſo belongs all acts of ſupernatural Faith, which are truly grounded on Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, we now come to inſpect the peculiar nature of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, which the Doctors of <hi>Rome</hi> attempt to affix to their Church: And though the word <hi>Church,</hi> taken in its greateſt latitude, include all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, whereſoever diſperſed, yet their Divines commonly reſtrain the meaning thereof to an Oecomenical Council, indicted by the Pope, promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Emperor, furniſhed with a ſufficient number of Fathers and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, wherein the Pope, by himſelf, or his Legate, preſides, and confirms the Canons and Decrees of the ſame, by his Apoſtolical Authority; ſo that a Council, with all theſe Requiſites, is that which they call the Church, and aſſert it Infallible in all its Canons and Decrees, yea and ſome of the Popes Candidates affirm, That his Holineſs alſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101117:16"/>participates of this high Prerogative, when he ſpeaks <hi>ex Cathedra,</hi> though no Council be then ſitting, which the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, the Popes Minions, ſtruggle hard to maintain againſt others of the ſame Church.</p>
               <p>Another difficulty hath been ſtarted amongſt them, How this Infallibility af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects their Church? Whither it be an inherent quality, poſſeſſing the minds and underſtandings of the Fathers and Biſhops in Council, eſſentially deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them to truth; or elſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſical aſſiſtance, whereby the Holy Ghoſt inſpires them with Truth, and protects them from Error. But I leave them to debate theſe difficulties among themſelves, for it is not the ſcope of this preſent diſcourſe to examine what they call their Church, and how this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility affects it, but only whither this ſingular favour be really granted to them, or whither they unjuſtly pretend a Right to it for the better ſatisfaction of their Followers, and making a more copious acceſs of Proſelites.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The Grounds of the pretended <hi>Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</head>
               <p>GReat Acquiſitions are ſeldom made and maintained without great Art and Induſtry. A conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of this ſublunary World, are wrought into a belief, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the only Oracle of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, whoſe Doctrine is always true, and not capable of Error: how many Kings and Princes are ſwayed by this perſwaſion? and by this means teſtifie a high Reſpect and Veneration for the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> who Commiſſionates her Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, the Divines, Preachers, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, to inculcate this Doctrine to the credulous Believers all the World over; and he who writes beſt on this Subject expects no leſs than a Cardinal's Cap, or a Biſhoprick, for his Reward: The Divine Prints it, the Preacher promulges it, and the Confeſſor takes hold of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, times, and ſeaſons, to ſettle it in the minds of his Penitents. Princes
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101117:17"/>have commonly Divines, Preachers, and Confeſſors of their own Subjects and Nation, to whoſe conduct they preſume they may ſafely truſt the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating of their Conſciences; yet theſe Men, though never ſo Heterogeneal in Dialect and National differences, make but one complex, or collection, of the Popes Negotiators, whoſe main ſcope and deſign is to maintain and improve the Prerogatives of their great Maſter, by all the ſubtle arts and ſedulous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry they are capable of: What plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Arguments do they uſe to perſuade people that their Church cannot Err? and the illiterate Vulgar greedily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Bait, which confirms them in their ſervitude and ſlavery, and makes them prompt to ſubmit to all the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> not regarding the arduity thereof.</p>
               <p>And among other marks of the Popes greatneſs, this of Infallibility is chief; for upon this Link hangs immediately his Supremacy, his Temporal pretended Power over Kings and Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Titles are deduced from his being univerſal Paſtor, which the non-erring Councils have declared him to be; ſo that the Councils Infallibility
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101117:17"/>is the Root of thoſe Prerogatives, it is the main Pillar which ſupports the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and Greatneſs of the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and if this ſhould fail, that Superſtructure would fall to utter Ruine and Deſolation. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the great Bulwark which dreads no oppoſition; this is the main Fort that ſtill remains immoveable againſt all attempts; this is the Ship of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which though toſſed and agitated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſwelling Billows, by Raging and Tempeſtuous Storms, yet never ſinks. Well may there be ſome attempts upon the out-works, by light Skirmiſhes and Velitations, in Controverſies of leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which if by immediate Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they cannot repel, recourſe may ſtill be had to the main Fort, and if that begins to open upon the Enemy, by Thundring Infallibility in his Ears, Lord! who can withſtand it? This will ſoon defeat him, and diſſipate all his attempts.</p>
               <p>But upon what grounds doth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> arrogate to it ſelf this high Character,<note place="margin">Firſt Proof.</note> in excluſion of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Why this is drawn from an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragable Teſtimony, it being ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Promiſes of Chriſt himſelf;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101117:18"/>for this is the Church to whom Chriſt hath promiſed, That <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt it:</hi> This is the Church, to whom Chriſt's word is engaged to ſend it <hi>another Paraclite, the Spirit of Truth, that ſhould lead it into all Truth.</hi> This is the Church to whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I will be with you till the end of the World.</hi> And finally this is the Church, committed to the care of St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> firſt Pope thereof, to whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Thy Faith ſhall never fail,</hi> which is meant of all other Popes, that by a lineal deſcent ſucceed him. And who dare attempt to evacuate Chriſt's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? Hence it comes to paſs that the Biſhops and Fathers aſſembled in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council, though of themſelves weak and ſubject to Error, yet being the chief Members of the Church, for Doctrine and Dignity, and being the Repreſentative of the whole, are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Infallible, as being backt by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority, by virtue of Chriſt's Promiſe; they do not now determine matters of Faith, and dogmatical points, as meer Men, but are as it were Deifi'd, in order to this Function, by a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural quality, infuſed into them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in their Intellects, or elſe by a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101117:18"/>previous diſpoſition, and concomitant operation of the Holy Ghoſt, which determines them to Truth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects them from Error: They are but the Organ to deliver Truth, but the Divine Oracle is the Dictator; they are but the inſtruments which convey thoſe Myſteries to the knowledge of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but the Spirit of God is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Agent; ſo that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Canons and Decrees come from them full fraught with the Divinity, which renders them Infallibly certain; for the Holy Ghoſt, every Seſſion, attends the motion of thoſe great Men, to regulate all their Proceedings by the never erring Rule of his infinite Veracity, whence it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, that to pick quarrels with their Definitions is a high Temerity; it is to wage War with Heaven, or by the weak ſcrutiny of humane diſcourſe, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the truth of ſuch Myſteries as Heaven hath revealed; which if they ſhould contain any ſeeming Error or Contradiction, yet our underſtanding muſt adhere to them, as infallibly true, becauſe our Reaſon is guided only by obſcure Notions, and abſtractive Acts, which draws in foreign Species by the mediation of the Senſes, which give but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101117:19"/>a glimmering light to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and often ſuggeſt Falſity for Truth: but the Decrees of Councils are ſacred, and carry the Seal of the Holy Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtampt upon them, by whoſe directions they are framed; wherefore it is no leſs than a Sacrilegious Preſumption, to Queſtion the Truth of them, for this is to oppoſe Human Reaſon againſt Divine Authority. This is the ſubſtance of their firſt Proof, drawn from the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Scripture, which at firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, ſeems great and glorious, a ſpecious pretence to work upon the credulity of the ignorant Vulgar.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Proof is grounded in Reaſon; but before we propoſe it, we muſt open the way, by putting the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in mind that the Divine Word, the Second Perſon of the Sacred Trinity, conſidering the deplorable condition of Mankind, by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon an efficacious Remedy, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume Human Nature, and by an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union to be Phiſically United, and become on with Fleſh and Bloud, and in that Nature to ſuffer death, and thereby to offer to his Eternal Father an infinite Treaſure of Merits and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make an attonement between
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101117:19"/>God and Man, and to ſatisfie for Mans tranſgreſſions, even to the rigor of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, becauſe the ſatisfaction was made in the ſame ſpecifical nature that offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and it was made to the full equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Crime, becauſe the Meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cauſe thereof was a Divine Perſon, of infinite Dignity, and therefore his Actions were of infinite Worth. But becauſe it was not permitted to every individual Perſon to draw from that infinite Maſs of Satisfaction and Merit, in what meaſure he pleaſed (this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being reſerved for the Pope alone to grant out of this ſtock by his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, what quantity, and to whom he deemed expedient) therefore a Church muſt be ordained, and a method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed how to apply the benefit of Chriſt's Paſſion to each one in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; To this end our great Redeemer inſtituted Sacraments, to be the organs and vehicles to convey the Fruit of his Paſſion to the Receiver; and this is <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda poſt naufragium tabula,</hi> whence the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith in her Publick Office, <hi>O felix culpa quae talem meruit Redemptorem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſuppoſed, The ſecond Proof is grounded on this conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101117:20"/>that the principal deſign of our Redeemer was to draw Souls to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, notwithſtanding the loſs ſuſtained by Original Sin, for to this end he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſatisfaction, to this end he meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted habitual and ſanctifying Grace, tranſient and actual Graces, prevenient, concomitant, and ſubſequent Graces, to illuminate the Underſtanding, to move and incline the Will, to embrace Good, and ſhun Evil. Wherefore this being the end intended by Chriſt, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that apt and fit means were alſo appointed, that had proportion with the obtaining of this end; but one ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means to accompliſh what Chriſt deſigned, is the Gift of Infallibility, without which the Church might fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Error, and from one Error into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and hereby deviate and ſwerve from its original inſtitution, and at length utterly fall away, and inſtead of conducting Souls to Heaven, it would lead them to the precipice of eternal ruine and deſtruction, and ſo evacuate the Fruit of Chriſts Paſſion, and put an obſtacle to the obtaining of that end which he efficaciouſly intended. And yet we muſt all ſuppoſe that the incarnate word was endu'd with an illimited Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101117:20"/>his Knowledge and Wiſdom was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, ſo that he perfectly knew what means were neceſſary to accompliſh his deſign, and wanted no Power to effect it, which notwithſtanding could never be efficaciouſly attained, without this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility; whence it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Chriſt communicated to his Church this ſpecial Preſervative of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways teaching truth, without being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Error. This briefly is the full ſtrength of their ſecond Proof.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the grounds of this Doctrin are ſeemingly convincing, and plauſible enough to induce ſuch to an aſſent, who either cannot, or will not, by a ſtudious conſideration penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the depth of them, but will rather acquieſce, than ſtretch their underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by a rigid ſcrutiny and inquiſition to detect the fallacy thereof. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in a matter of ſuch moment we are not to take up all this upon truſt, nor blindly to give our aſſent, till we have induſtriouſly waighed and ponder'd the whole matter, that ſo we may be the better able to give an account of our belief, which is the drift of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Section.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The Deciſion of the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.</head>
               <p>THe Aſſertion is, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> enjoys not this Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which they ſo much pretend to The firſt Proof, Such a previous neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Truth, would deſtroy Liberty, and take away the laudability and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of human actions. Note, That in the progreſs of this Diſcourſe I ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> that is, I ſhall take along with me their own Principles, and for the moſt part ground my Refutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon them. They all grant Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Merit in ſuch human actions as have conformity to the <hi>dictamen</hi> of Conſcience; for in this conſiſts the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our Actions, that they are conſonant or diſſonant to the <hi>ſyndereſis</hi> of the Agent, but if an action be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted by an antecedent neceſſity, there can be no exerciſe of Free-will, nor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in it, nor Liberty, becauſe that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only hath liberty, which after all prae-requiſites and cauſes are put, hath a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101117:21"/>power to work and not to work; whereas if there be a prae-ordination by Gods Decree, that the Members of a General-Council ſhall be determined to Truth, then their deciſions are wholly deſtitute of Liberty and Free-will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gods efficatious Decree, that hath a previous influence upon the action, draws with it an indiſpenſable neceſſity which deſtroys Free-will; neither can it be meritorious, becauſe Merit ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Liberty, and conſiſts in the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the action; and how can that action be laudable, which a fatal neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity forces from the Will? Can any one deſerve Praiſe for doing that which he cannot avoid?</p>
               <p>Hence I conclude, that Merit and Free-will are not compatible with that Infallibility which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends to, which is inconſiſtent with Gods Providence, in order to Mankind, who was Created, and Born free, in full poſſeſſion of the liberty of his will, and therefore ſhall be Judged according to his own Actions, which could not be, were there any neceſſity or reſtraint put upon them; Thus we ſee how this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine inverts the order of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and impoſes a neceſſity, either
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:101117:22"/>of contrariety, or contradiction upon Humane actions.</p>
               <p>A confirmation of this Proof may be drawn from the practical proceeding of Councils, who ſeldom or never deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any thing till after a long and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Debate, and ſometimes with great fervor and animoſity of Parties, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to each other (as it hapned in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>) upon contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Points, one Party Affirming what another Deny'd. All which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a liberty in their debates and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations; for if by an Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> they were all fixt in Truth, What need any Debate or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation? for this can only have place in ſuch Reſolutions as depend upon Humane Prudence alone. And if each Member of a General Council hath the immediate Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> How comes it to paſs, that when two are of different Opinions, the one Denies what the other Affirms; and though they may both ſpeak as they think, yet in reality they cannot both ſpeak Truth, for two contradictories cannot be both true; Muſt then the Spirit of God be made the Author of both? as though he ſuggeſted Truth to the one, and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101117:22"/>to the other? if not, then he that contends for the Erroneous part, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the Holy Ghoſt, and agitated by ſome other Spirit of the Prince of Darkneſs, which allways oppoſeth truth; but hence it would follow, that Satan acts in General Councils, and that ſome of the Members of Councils are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently not Infallible.</p>
               <p>The Second Proof is a Refutation of the Grounds of the Adverſe Party. A Negative Tenet, as this is, cannot be better prov'd, than by ſhewing the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Affirmative Contradictory; Firſt then, as to their Argument drawn from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Promiſes expreſt in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. I demand, Whence they have an Aſſured Infallibility, that Scripture contains the True Word of God? They Anſwer, That this Infallible Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath Defined it ſo to be, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it to the People to be ſo believed. I demand again how they make out the Infallibility of their Church? They An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, By <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Promiſes in Scripture. A ſpecial Argument, no better than a plain vitious Circle; for they prove the Infallibility of the Scripture, by the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101117:23"/>Church, and the Infallibility of the Church by Scripture; and prove nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Independent of each other. By this way of Arguing <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his <hi>Alchoran</hi> may be prov'd Infallible. For the <hi>Alchoran</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Mahomet</hi> was inſpired by God, who ſpoke in his eare in the forme of a Dove; and <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Alchoran</hi> is the Word of God, manifeſted by Divine Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore both <hi>Mahomet</hi> and the <hi>Alchoran</hi> are Infallible. This is the ſame Argument apply'd to another ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> hath as great a Veneration for Scripture, and as ſtrong and firm adherence to it as any can have, yet are not ſo highly preſumptuous as to arrogate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a degree of Evidence, or Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility exceeding that which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Inductive to their Beliefe bring with them: But I ſhall not need to inſiſt upon the Invalidity of this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe it hath lately been ſo Learnedly handled by that Worthy and Profound Dr. <hi>Edw. Stillingfleet</hi> Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> and Chaplain in Ordinary to His Majeſty, againſt Mr. <hi>Edw. Worſley,</hi> a Learned <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> then reſiding at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:101117:23"/>who had formerly, for many years together, been a Reader of <hi>Divinity</hi> in the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Colledge at <hi>Liege,</hi> where he Taught the whole Body of <hi>Divinity,</hi> yet could never extricate himſelf out of this Labyrinth wherein Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> had involved him, by this Argument: to which I refer the <hi>Reader.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Circle being therefore laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, let us examine if the Scripture In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the Churches Definition, bring with it this Infallibility or no. The Scripture is queſtionleſs of it ſelf Infallible, but it is not ſo to us: for we have but a Moral certainty of the Infallibility of Scripture, and that it is truly, and <hi>à parte rei,</hi> the Word of God. The reaſon is, becauſe though we admit that what the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> have left Written, was truly dictated by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet they who drew Copies from thoſe Originals, wanted that ſupport, they were meer Men, and carried their Humane Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties about them, and in after ages, as the Scripture was handed down to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, the <hi>Amanuenſes,</hi> by Ignorance, Malice, or Neglect, might commit ſome Error, either by exceſs, by defect, or by alteration, whereby their Copies might
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:101117:24"/>diſagree with the Originals of the firſt <hi>Hagiographers,</hi> at leaſt we have no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, nor Revelation to aſſure us of the contrary; and when <hi>Printing</hi> came in, the ſame difficulty occurs, in relation to them that Corrected the <hi>Print.</hi> But when it was Tranſlated into ſeveral Languages, the difficulty is yet greater; for beſide the former caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, admit the Tranſlator to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Linguiſt, yet the Senſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is ſo very nice, that in his Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation he might innocently expreſs, what the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> by the Original ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meant. Beſides, that only part of Scripture is admitted, by both Churches, as the Word of God, which is Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, And what Infallible Rule have we to know, what part is Canonical, what Apocryphal? Again, in that part that is received as Canonical, there are ſo many high Myſteries, ſome ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, not pervious to the Natural capacity of Mans underſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile; the ſeveral ſenſes thereof are ſo various, ſome paſſages are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Literally, ſome Morally, others Allegorically, ſome others Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologically, or Figuratively. How many Volumes have been Written by
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:101117:24"/>the Learned in both Churches, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret the meaning and true ſenſe of Scripture? and in ſome places with Contradictions, and Oppoſitions, to each other, yet after all we fall ſhort of any Infallible Certainty herein: for inſtance, there have been above Fifty ſeveral Senſes given by Interpreters of that ſhort Sentence, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my Body.</hi> And one Verſe in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> hath puzled the Learnedſt of them all, <hi>viz. Increpa feras arundinis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 68. v. 30.</note> 
                  <hi>congregatio taurorum in vaccis populo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, ut excludant eos qui probati ſunt argento,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus: <hi>Rebuke the wilde beaſts of a Reed; the congregation of Bulls in the Cowes of the people, that they may exclude thoſe that are tryed with ſilver.</hi> Inſtances of this nature are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in Scripture. Humane Tradition hath brought the Scripture down to theſe our times, yet Humane Authority is not Infallible, wherefore all theſe particulars being duly ponder'd, Where will the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> find that aſſured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility which they pretend to?</p>
               <p>As for the Second Proof from the ſtrength of Reaſon, we admit <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Omnipotence, Omniſcience, his infinite Prudence, and Wiſdom, with all other
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:101117:25"/>his Divine Attributes; we alſo grant that our Redeemers Intention of being Incarnate, Suffering Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was to ſave the Souls of Men; but this was to be conſiſtent with, and ſubordinate to that ſtate wherein the Almighty, by his infinite Wiſdom and Providence, had placed Man in his firſt Creation, that is, with a full poſſeſſion, and uſe of his Liberty and Free-will, which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer never intended to infringe, for that would ſubvert the Order of Gods former Providence: So that by the Fruit of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Paſſion we are furniſhed with all neceſſaries to live a godly and a righteous Life, which without the Grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> would not be in our power to do, for bare Nature hath no proportion of it ſelf to Merit, <hi>ne quidem de congruo,</hi> nor to any Supernatural Reward, as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> Teacheth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Maſſilienſes:</hi> ſo that the Supernatural Graces that we receive by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Merits, give us a power to do good, and ſhun evil, but impoſe no neceſſity upon us to lay hold of them, and improve them to our own good, for this depends upon our own free election; therefore when we tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs againſt Gods Precepts, it is not for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:101117:25"/>want of all neceſſary means to obſerve them, but it proceeds from the Pravity of our own Wills, which chuſe rather to follow the ſuggeſtion of the ſenſual appetite, than ſubmit to the conduct of Reaſon, and therefore are blameworthy, for we had the power to do good, and avoid evil, and would not.</p>
               <p>So that although of our ſelves we can do nothing in order to heaven, yet every individual Member of the Church, by the Grace obtained by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is enabled, but not neceſſitated, to ſave his Soul. <hi>Non ego ſed gratia Dei mecum.</hi> It is not I, but the Grace of God with me. And if the Church ſhould fall into an Error (as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath done) the members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are not thereby deprived of the uſual Means of Salvation, neither doth that Error prejudice them as long as they remain in an invincible Ignorance of the Truth. But if the Church by multiplying error upon error, ſhould fall from being a Church, which could not be, but that the wiſeſt and moſt learned ſhould take notice thereof, and detect the errors, then theſe are bound in conſcience to deſert it, and deteſt their errors, who conſequently would
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:101117:26"/>remain conſtant and faithful to truth, and ſo would continue the True Church.</p>
               <p>And indeed, the Second Proof pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the Second <hi>Section</hi> proves too much, and is to be ſolved by the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> themſelves; for they Aſſert, that the end of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Suffering was to ſave all Mankind, that is, every ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Humane Nature, and therefore apt and proportionable means ought to be inſtituted, without which this end could not be efficaciouſly obtained; whence it enſues, that every individual perſon muſt have this Infallibility, yea, and impeccability alſo, leſt <hi>Christ</hi>'s de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhould be fruſtrated: which is the ſame way of Arguing as is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Proof, and the illation as evidently enſues; which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we all grant falſe and erroneous, for then none could be damned. Thus you ſee the grounds of the <hi>Romans</hi> Infallibility, how ſpecious and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſoever they appear, yet thoroughly examined, and the fallacies detected, they vaniſh to ſmoak.</p>
               <p>The Third Proof: That Church which hath committed Errors, and ſtill perſeveres in them, is not Infallible;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:101117:26"/>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted errors, and ſtill perſiſts in them, as I ſhall prove in the following Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this <hi>Treatiſe, ergo,</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not Infallible: for that Church that actually doth erre, hath a power to erre, becauſe <hi>bene valet ab actu ad potentiam:</hi> and it is evident, that that Church which hath power or capacity to erre, is not Infallible; for Infallibility excludes a power of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>There yet remains to ſolve ſuch Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, as may be propoſed againſt our Aſſertion contained in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this <hi>Section.</hi>

               <p>THe firſt Objection: None can Queſtion but that ſuch Promiſes as our Redeemer hath truly made to his Church, ſhall be fulfilled; but we have a Moral certainty, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſpecifyed in the Second <hi>Section</hi> were truly made by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Moral certainty, That the <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> is truly the <hi>Word of God:</hi> Whence it enſues, that we are Morally certain that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deſtroys it ſelf; for it contends for an Infallibility, and proves it by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flex act of Moral certainty; whereas In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility excludes a power of Erring, and Moral certainty includes that power, ſo that the reſult of both would be, a Fallible Infallibility, which involves a Contradiction. This
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:101117:27"/>is much of the nature of a Sillogiſme, wherein the concluſion <hi>ſemper ſequitur debiliorem partem;</hi> ſo that if one of the premiſes be ſcientifical, the other on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable, the concluſion will be only probable; the reaſon is, becauſe in the concluſion, the two extreams are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore identifi'd between themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were in the premiſes identi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with a third; wherefore if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream be certainly identifi'd with a third, the other only probably, they can but be probably identifi'd with each other, for this identity is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſeparating either of the extreams from the third. For application, The Infallibility of the Church depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe two Principles; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we are Infallibly certain that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are performed. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we are Infallibly certain of the thing of fact, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Promiſe; if either of theſe fail, the Infallibility faileth; and if either of theſe be only probable, the Infallibility is reduced to a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility only; now though Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty be the higheſt degree of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, yet it comes as far ſhort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, as this Argument doth of proving it.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer: That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is too forward in arrogating to themſelves alone, ſuch Promiſes as <hi>Chriſt</hi> made to his Church; for to ſay nothing of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, yet ſince their manifold Innovations and Superſtructures, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church is the purer, and freer from Error; and conſequently hath more right to lay hold of thoſe Promiſes then the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Objection: Though the Church, taken barely by it ſelf, and without the ſupport of that Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from <hi>Holy Writ,</hi> ſhould not be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, yet backt by the Motives of Credibility, it will be rendred abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unerrable; for theſe Motives do ſo peculiarly affect it, and as it were point it out to be the True Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that it diſſipates all the Clouds of Ambiguity, which blind the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous; For who can conſider the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal deſcent and ſucceſſion of Chief Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, the auſterity and holineſs of life exerciſed in Monaſteries, of both Sexes; the Miracles wrought by the Members of this Church, with the Blood of ſo
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:101117:28"/>many Martyrs, the effuſion whereof doth daily irrigate the ſame, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it more fertile, with other Motives of this nature, which all are the Badges of this Church. Who, I ſay, can ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ponder this, without framing an Infallible Judgment, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the True <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt?</hi> There is certainly a ſtrict and Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical connexion, between theſe Motives, and the True Church, for it is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Divine Goodneſs, and veracity of God, to co-operate to ſuch a Deluſion, as this would be, if theſe Motives ſhould indicate a Falſe Church, ſubject to Error, which would make God himſelf the Author of this Error: We may therefore hence conclude, the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which ſuch great Wonders are ſo frequently wrought, to be the True, and Infallible Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt Anſwer:</hi> Among all the Doctors and Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I never knew of any that aſſerted this ſtrict and metaphyſical connexion of the Motives of Credibility with the True Church, but only Cardinal <hi>Lugo.</hi> Yet I have ſeen a whole Torrent of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:101117:29"/>Autority of other Doctors of the ſame Church, of the contrary opinion, who all affirm, that the collection of theſe Motives, may poſſibly affect a falſe Church; wherefore let theſe Authors ſolve this Objection.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second Anſwer.</hi> All theſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of credibility are fallacious, as depending upon Humane Autority, and being ſubject to many caſualties and deceits; and firſt for the ſucceſſion of Chief Paſtors, whoſe Juriſdiction, by an Illegal Uſurpation, extends it ſelf <hi>de facto,</hi> over the whole Body, but is limited <hi>de jure,</hi> to the Dioceſs of <hi>Rome</hi> only; and how long together hath the Body been without a head, as if it had been defunct? and then Monſter-like, it appeared with two heads, it being hard to decide which of them had moſt right. And what is to be ſaid of <hi>Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> Pope, who ſubſcribed the <hi>Arians</hi> Hereſie, and joyned with them; and of <hi>Vigilius,</hi> who approved and condemned the ſame Doctrine in the three Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Muſt theſe alſo be links of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation in the Succeſſion? Surely they were not Infallible. Conſider the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Election, when there oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:101117:29"/>a vacancy, there will not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe in the Colledge of Cardinals, who have ambition enough to aſpire to ſuch a dignity, whereto is annexed a Temporal Principality, a Triple Crown, with many ſplendid Titles, which makes the Succeſſion ſure; But how few are there in the Conſiſtory, who are ſwayed by Piety, and Religion, to give their Suffrage only for ſuch a Perſon as is duely qualified for ſo high a Prelacy? But, when they have entred the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,</hi> What a Bundle of Ambition is there ſhut up together? How many are there that take their Meaſures from By and Siniſter ends? ſome from Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, others from Humane Policy, others again from Self-intereſt; ſome give their Votes for ſuch a Cardinal, becauſe he is of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Faction, they having a Penſion to uphold that Faction. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers chuſe another, becauſe he is of the <hi>French</hi> Faction, whoſe Penſioners they are; Others chuſe one who is moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to themſelves, hoping that by his Promotion, they ſhall become great and powerful; another again, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf fit to be elected, caſts away his own Vote upon one that is moſt unlike to be choſen, leſt his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:101117:30"/>by making acceſs to the Party of his Competitor, ſhould promote him, and deprive himſelf of ſo high a Dignity. What ſtuff is this, to have an influence upon the Electors of a Chief Paſtor? nay, How remote is all this from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility? As for Auſterity, I believe that many out of a true Motive of Piety are wrought to imbrace it; But how many more are there that glory in their groſs and vile habit, and ſo are proud of their ſeeming Humility? and in ſtead of holineſs of life, How many enormous crimes are committed within thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Walls? they have their Pride, Ambition, and Factions one againſt another, eſpecially among the Female Sex. For Miracles, How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands have been cry'd up as true, and afterwards decry'd, when the Fallacy was detected? And how many have the repute of Martyrs, who in reality were Malefactors, deſerving death? But how many Martyrs have the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> made in <hi>England,</hi> by putting them to death meerly <hi>in odium fidei?</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is plain and evident, that all theſe particulars being doubtful and uncertain, no Infallibility can be hence evinced.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:101117:30"/>
               <p>The Third Objection: They whoſe reaſon and underſtandings are convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the truth of the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, are bound in conſcience to believe it as the true Church of God. For there is a Divine Precept ſtill incumbent upon them, which commands them not to ſin; therefore it commands them the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means to avoid ſin: but as they ſtand convinced, the neceſſary means to avoid ſin, is to believe it to be the true Church of God; but it cannot be, that God ſhould command Men to believe an error, or that which is falſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is an infallible truth, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the true Church of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> for elſe God would command us to believe falſity, and error, and ſo God himſelf would be the Author of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, by retorting this Argument: The <hi>Greeks,</hi> for Example, who hear their learned Doctors, and Preachers Explicate and Preach their Doctrine of the Trinity, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> doth not proceed from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> but only from the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> by the <hi>Son,</hi> which they propoſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:101117:31"/>with ſo much plauſibility, and ſeeming truth, that the hearers are convinced of the truth thereof, as belonging to Faith; in this caſe God commands them not to ſin; and conſequently commands the neceſſary means to avoid ſin, which is to believe that Doctrine as an Article of Faith; which notwithſtanding is falſe and erroneous. I aske the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> Whether in this caſe God commands the <hi>Greeks</hi> to believe this error? and if they ſolve this Argument, they will ſolve their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That in the caſe propoſed in the Argument, I admit a Precept of not ſinning; but I deny any Precept of believing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Church of God. Nay, ſuch a belief, upon the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of truth, would be a ſin; for ſuch an eaſie belief, upon ungrounded, though plauſible Arguments, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Moment, is an act of raſhneſs, and temerity, which, I am ſure, are no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; and conſequently not command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Gods Precept. The reaſon is, becauſe where there are ſeveral means to attain an end, though the end be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Precept, yet no means in particular
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:101117:31"/>falls under the ſame Precept, as in the caſe propoſed, They who ſeem to be convinced of the truth of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ought in prudence to ſuſpend their Judgment, to Read <hi>Authors</hi> that Treat of ſuch matters, to Converſe with Men of Integrity, Piety, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Learning, and then ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to ponder, and maturely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the whole matter; this is an act of Prudence, and Diſcretion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no ſin; ſo that the Perſons in the Caſe propoſed are not reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one only means of avoiding ſin, but may make uſe of any that is ſit, and apt in order to that end. Elſe they muſt acknowledge the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church to be True and Orthodox: for they who are convinced that this Church is the true Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are commanded not to ſin; and ſo to believe that the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church of <hi>England</hi> is the True Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which muſt be ſo, becauſe God cannot command us to believe an Error.</p>
               <p>But you may Inſtance, That an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Church is certainly better then a Fallible one, and the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is ſuch, as always to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine him to do that wich is beſt;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:101117:32"/>and conſequently in this caſe hath made his Church Infallible, this being beſt. I Anſwer: The Principle on which this Inſtance is grounded, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly rejected by the <hi>Roman</hi> Divines;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> 1 <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> D. Thomae.</note> for though <hi>Granado</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Jeſuite doth fuſely contend to eſtabliſh a neceſſity in God to do always that which is beſt; yet I have heard him earneſtly impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by other Profeſſors of Divinity, of the ſame order, and in the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of St. <hi>Hermeingildus,</hi> where <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado</hi> himſelf Taught it, and Printed it; and though he have ſome Sectators in this Point, yet a far greater number of Doctors, of ſeveral Orders, Teach the contrary.</p>
               <p>The caſe ſtands thus: Here are two of Gods Attributes, <hi>viz.</hi> his Liberty, and Infinite Goodneſs, brought in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with each other: <hi>Granado,</hi> to maintain the Goodneſs of God, detracts from his Abſolute Liberty, and Freedom; which notwithſtanding is as Eſſential to God, as his Goodneſs. Other <hi>Authors</hi> induſtrioufly contend to defend the Attribute of Goodneſs, without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of liberty; for without any ſuch fatal neceſſity of reſtraining the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:101117:32"/>he hath an ample field wherein to diſplay his Goodneſs. That we have our Being is an effect of Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that we are repleniſht with all Neceſſaries, and Conve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">
                     <desc>••…</desc>
                  </gap>ences in this life, flows from his Bounty and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that we were Redeemed when we were loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> was Gods great Goodneſs towards us; that we are now furniſhed with all Neceſſary Means of Salvation proceeds from Gods Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and the Ineffable and Eternal Goods of Heaven, which we hope for, are no other then the products of Gods Infinite Goodneſs and Mercy. Beſides, we are no competent Judges whether a Fallible, or Infallible Church be beſt; for the ſecond in it ſelf ſeems beſt to us; yet the All-ſeeing Eye of God, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly comprehends all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, together with all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations and Subordinations of one thing towards another, in relation to the Divine Intention, it may be, for ought we know, that a Church liable to error, All things conſidered, may be the beſt.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, according to my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purpoſe, I have delivered the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I Deſigned in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:101117:33"/>Methodically, and with as much Brevity as was conſiſtent with the clear underſtanding of the ſame; Wherein, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I propoſed ſeveral Principles and Maxims of the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctors, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and uſeful for the ſubſequent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I gave you the grounds of their pretended Infallibility, without diſſembling any thing of their full ſtrength. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſet down my Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, and Proofes thereof, deſtructive of that Infallibility. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Objections: which Method I ſhall obſerve for the future, and hereby we may conſider, upon how weak a foundation, this Main Pillar of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is grounded, whereby the whole ſtructure becomes disjoyned, and ruinous.</p>

               <p>THere are various Principles, and Dogmatical Deciſions, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> much conducing to this preſent Diſcourſe, whereof ſome are defined by their General Councils; others are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly Taught and Aſſerted by their Divines. And becauſe I here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to argue <hi>ad hominem,</hi> that is, out of their own Doctrine; I ſhall therefore do them no wrong, by drawing ſuch il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:101117:34"/>from thence, as ſhall clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their violating of Divine Right; by endeavouring, as much as in them lyeth, to make an Eſſential change in their Sacraments, which they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore, They admit Seven Sacraments, to wit, <hi>Baptiſme, Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Eucharist, Pennance, Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Order</hi> and <hi>Matrimony.</hi> And though they ground themſelves upon ſeveral Texts of Scripture miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood for the practice of them, yet it is a buſineſs of greater arduity to prove them all Sacraments; but to ſatisfie their Sectators, they need no more then to tell them, that theſe are all defined, to be Sacraments, by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in theſe words; <hi>Si quis dixerit Sacramenta novae legis non fuiſſe omnia à Jeſu Christo Domino Noſtro inſtituta;</hi>

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not the drift of my preſent deſign to examin the truth hereof, I ſhall therefore wave it, and only ſuppoſe it to be their Doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They admit, that all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments were Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for as much as concerns the Eſſence and Subſtance of them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it exceeds the limits of any Humane Power, either to abrogate, or to alter any thing of that which is by Divine Right eſtabliſhed, and that they were all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> is alſo defined by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as above, and Aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Divines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In every Sacrament they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between the Eſſential, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental parts of it; the Eſſential parts they place in the matter and forme; the Accidental parts are the Ceremonies, Prayers, Unctions, and Actions, which are uſed in the Adminiſtration of them,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:101117:35"/>which they call not <hi>Sacramenta,</hi> but <hi>Sacramentalia.</hi> And whenſoever the Eſſential parts are daily applyed to the Receiver, though the Accidental parts are omitted, yet the Sacrament is valid: But if either of the Eſſential parts be wanting, that is, if either the true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the true forme which <hi>Chriſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted be not applyed, then the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is void, as their Divines Teach: For example, in the Sacrament of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> there is <hi>materia proxima,</hi> and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria remota,</hi> a remote, and an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate matter: the remote is the natural Element of Water, the immediate is the Lotion, or the action, whereby the Baptiſer applyes the Water to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed; during which action the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Form is to be pronounced by the Baptiſer in theſe words: <hi>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> In this matter and forme conſiſts the whole Subſtance and Eſſence of this Sacrament, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if by reaſon of the weakneſs of the Child, or by any other incident caſualty the other Ceremonies cannot be performed, yet the Child is Truly Baptized, though performed by the Midwife, or any other perſon, becauſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:101117:36"/>all the eſſential parts of Baptiſm, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by Chriſt, are duly applyed to the Child, though the Unctions, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and other Ceremonies be omitted; and they inſiſt ſo earneſtly upon theſe eſſential parts, that in caſe no other Water could be had but Roſe-water, or ſome other Liquor that hath affinity with Water, they hold the Sacrament not valid, becauſe the Matter inſtituted by Chriſt is wanting, which is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Element of Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They hold that though the Matter and Form be the whole Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Sacrament, yet if they be not conjoined ſo as to make up one thing, the Sacrament is nul, and of no effect; for the form muſt be applied to the matter, and have a moral conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitance with it, or elſe it cannot have a moral union with the ſame; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Water in Baptiſm be applyed to day to the Baptiſed, and the form pronounced to morrow, there will be no Baptiſm, nor Sacrament, for the words would be falſe, which ſignifie a preſent Lotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Of all the ſeven Sacramentss which they admit, they aſſert that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:101117:36"/>three, to wit, Baptiſm, Confirmation, and Order, do imprint upon the Soul of the Receiver an indelible, ſpiritual Character, never to be blotted out, ſo as thoſe Souls which receive any of theſe three Sacraments, after ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Body, will appear in the next World, with theſe characteriſtical Notes inſtampt upon them, ſome with one, ſome with two, others with all three, according to their reſpective dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, they having an eſſential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepation from one another, each of them denoting the Sacrament from whence they proceeded. Hence they infer, that none of theſe three Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when once validly conferr'd, can be reiterated, or received twice by the ſame Perſon, and that it would be a Sacriledge to attempt it; becauſe they fruſtrate the effect of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet if there ariſe any doubt of the validity of the former collation, then a ſtrict inquiry is to be made how grounded that doubt is, and if it be ſtill found ambiguous, then that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be again conferr'd <hi>ſub condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> But if it be evident that there was wanting either the true matter or the true forme, which are all the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:101117:37"/>or the right intention of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrer (which is alſo neceſſary;) In this caſe the Sacrament is to be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red again <hi>abſolutè.</hi> Having thus made a brief reflection upon the Principles, and Practiſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in what relates to this matter: I now proceed to prove <hi>ad hominem,</hi> their treſpaſſes againſt Divine Right, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from Chriſts Inſtitutions, and introducing in place thereof their own humane inventions, but ſhall deſire you firſt to take a curſory view of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rites of Ordaining Prieſts.</p>

Yet they deny that the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:101117:66"/>Humane Nature was converted into the Divine Nature, for that imports a deſtruction of the Human Nature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no Converſion could ſubſiſt.

Then they return again, and the Biſhop puts his right hand upon the head of each of them, and the Prieſts that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do the like, putting their hands by the Biſhops. Then the Biſhop ſays a Prayer, imploring Grace for them that are to be Ordained, that they may worthily comply with the Functions of Prieſthood.

                  <hi>Domitius Chamerota</hi> aſſerts that by the Tradition of the Veſſels, the Charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is Imprinted, and the Ordained is properly a Prieſt.

Hence they reſolve, that if it be certain that the Ordained did not touch the Chalice, or if he did touch the Chalice, but not the Patene, he muſt be Reordained abſolutely; but if it be doubtful whether he touched them or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:101117:78"/>no, then he is to be Ordained again conditionally, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if there be clear evidence, that one in his Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did not touch thoſe Veſſels, I would fain know whether any Divine in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> either Moral or Scholaſtical, dare aſſert, that ſuch a one ought not to be Reordained?</p>

So that if we conſult Autority, this Poſition muſt certainly prevail.</p>
               <p>A Second Proof is grounded in this Principle, That not only the matter and form, which are the Eſſentials, but alſo a right intention in the Miniſter is rigorouſly neceſſary for the validity of Order. So the Council of <hi>Florence:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Florent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <hi>Haec omnia Sacramenta tribus perſiciun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:101117:79"/>videlicet rebus tanquam materia, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis tanquam forma, &amp; perſona Ministri conferentis Sacramentum cum intentione faciendi quae facit Eccleſia; quorum ſi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquod deſit, non perficitur Sacramentum.</hi> All theſe Sacraments are perfected by three things, to wit, by Things as the Matter, by Words as the Form, and by the Perſon of the Miniſter, conferring the Sacrament with intention to do that which the Church doth: whereof, if any be wanting, the Sacrament is not compleat. This ſuppoſed, I prove my intent; for the Miniſter of Prieſthood ought not, cannot in prudence have any intention to confer this Order by any other matter and forme, then the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Veſſels and this forme, <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipe poteſtatem offerendi ſacrificium pro vivis &amp; defunctis, in nomine Patris,</hi> &amp;c. Take power to offer Sacrifice for the Living and the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for by theſe words he is to give the Ordained a Power to offer Sacrifice, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the Order of Prieſthood, according to them. Wherefore, if his intention do not accompany the plain, clear, and explicit ſenſe of his words, it would be a meer fiction; for he ſaith, Take, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in the mean time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:101117:79"/>to give them nothing: and ſo without this intention he would be a meer deluder. Hence I conclude, that he muſt intend to confer the Order of Prieſthood by that matter and forme; neither can he affix his intention to the Impoſition of hands, nor to any thing elſe contained in the forme of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for then he would attempt to confer the ſame Order to the ſame perſon twice, which is a Sacrilege in all Sacraments that imprint a Character, as the Order of Prieſthood doth.</p>
               <p>But it may be Objected, That the Ordainer directs not his intention to this particular matter nor that, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates himſelf by the intention of the Church, without examining particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> directs. 'Tis well that you have exempted the Ordainer from reprehenſion: But then I muſt demand, What intention the Church had in introducing this new Matter and Forme? ſo explicitely, and in expreſs terms ſignifying the collation of Prieſtly Power to proced from hence, and conſequently the Character to be hereby imprinted? for if theſe are not intended as Eſſentials, then you have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:101117:80"/>removed the ſiction from the Ordainer, and attributed it to the Church; ſo that the one or the other muſt be the Author of it, but as to this preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie it matters not which. And indeed, to ſolve all, there is but one way, which is, to grant, that the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Veſſels, and the Forme of Words thereunto annexed, do Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally confer the Order, and imprint the Character.</p>
               <p>The Third Proofe is made out by induction, which to effect, we muſt make a ſtrict inquiry into all the parts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Roman Ritual,</hi> to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, if any one of them have any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable capacity in order to this effect. The firſt impoſition of hands can have none, becauſe there is no Form appropriated to it, neither can a bare Matter without a Forme, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the adequate Eſſence of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. The Second Impoſition of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ands, though there be a Form accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to it, yet it is neither Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or Enunciative, nor Imperative, but only Deprecatory, which is not ſufficient to ſatisfie the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> But however, as the <hi>Roman Ritual</hi> for
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:101117:80"/>Prieſthood is diſpoſed, the Order of Prieſthood can never proceed from hence, except the touching of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with its Forme, be wholly left out; for in caſe Prieſthood ſhould be valid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conferr'd by this Impoſition of Hands and its Forme, then the tendring the Veſſels afterwards to him that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Ordained, with theſe words, <hi>Accipe poteſtatem:</hi> Take a power to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would be a Sacrilegious and Fallacious attempt to Reordain him that was before validly Ordained, and had the Character of Prieſthood imprinted upon him, and this would be conſtantly practiſed through the whole extent of the Church. Beſides, this Doctrine is wholly deſtitute of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, for there are few or no Divines that inſiſt upon this. What then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains? only the Third Impoſition of Hands, which follows a long time after, about the end of Maſs, with theſe words, <hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remiſeritis peccata, remittuntur eis, &amp; quorum retinueritis, retenta ſunt.</hi> Receive the Holy Ghoſt: they whoſe ſins you forgive are forgiven, and they whoſe ſins you retain are retained. This likewiſe hath no proportion to
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:101117:81"/>confer the Order of Prieſthood. Firſt, becauſe it ſuppoſeth that Order alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conferr'd; for none but a Prieſt is ſufficiently qualified to receive a Power of Relaxing and Retaining ſins. But in the Primitive Church, this power was ever eſteemed a branch of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, neceſſarily reſulting from the Validity of Ordination, ſo that all Prieſts had the Radical Power of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving, but they were not to practice it without a Deputation from their Biſhop: neither is it above Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and Fifty years ſince this Forme was thruſt into the <hi>Ritual,</hi> and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its novelty, as not being inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as Eſſential to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Prieſthood, cannot participate of the nature of a Sacrament, nor any way belong to the Eſſentials of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Laſtly, That this Matter and Forme have no influence upon the Power of Conſecrating, or offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, is evidently evinced from hence, That all they who receive it, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid Maſs with the Biſhop, and Conſecrated with him, and to that end the Canon, and eſpecially the words of Conſecration (that uſually are pronounced with a lower voice)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:101117:81"/>are by the Biſhop pronounced aloud, and diſtinctly, becauſe the Ordained may accompany him, for he that firſt ends the words of Conſecration, doth truly Conſecrate, and none of the reſt, except they direct their intention to that inſtant in which the Biſhop pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the laſt lyllable. How then can this laſt impoſition of Hands, or its Forme, any way conduce to the Power of Order? It therefore remains, that nothing contained in the <hi>Roman Ritual</hi> for Prieſthood, can be Eſſential to that Order, except the Tradition of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels with its Forme; all the reſt being accidentary, and circumſtantial, as I ſhall prove hereafter by their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.</p>
               <p>All this is confirmed by the practiſe preſcribed in the <hi>Roman Ritual</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading a Prieſt. <hi>Miniſtri tradunt in manus degradandi, calicem cum vino &amp; aqua, ac patena, &amp; hoſtia, quam Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex Degradator, aufert de manibus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradandi.</hi> The Miniſters deliver into the hands of him that is to be degraded, a Chalice with Wine, and Water, and a Patene and Hoaſte, which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that is the Degrader, takes out of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101117:82"/>the hands of the degraded; becauſe, by delivering theſe Veſſels to him, he was Ordained Prieſt: and therefore by taking them from him again, they think him ſufficiently deveſted of that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>This Truth is ſo apparent, that it needs no other proofe, then to obſerve in their Ordination, how indifferent and unconcerned they are in all parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, except in delivering the Veſſels, and pronouncing the Forme that affects them, here one Prieſt inſpects one ſide, another ſurveys the other ſide, and they keep ſuch a preſſing of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineds hands, both on the Patene and Chalice, that no Error be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the application of theſe Veſſels, that the beholder will preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they eſteem the whole ſubſtance of Ordination to conſiſt in this. Diſcourſe their Clergy, and you will find, that no one doubts it. Read the Forme, <hi>Accipe poteſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and you will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that it ſignifieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. And they who live amongſt them and converſe with them, cannot but know their general and unanimous belief and perſwaſion, that the Order of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101117:82"/>Prieſthood is validly conferr'd by the touching of thoſe Veſſels, and the Form which accompanys it, and the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter thereby imprinted, and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Grace conferr'd.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, as to the thing in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I offer this Dilemma: either the Order of Prieſthood is validly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd by touching the Veſſels, and the Forme appropriated to it, and the Character thereby imprinted, or not. If the firſt be granted, that is the ſcope of our preſent intention. If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, then I declare, that the words which the Ordainer pronounceth, are Nugatory, Deluſive, and Fallacious; for the words are Imperative, whereby the Biſhop bids the Ordained receive a power of offering Sacrifice (which in effect is Prieſthood) and the Ordained, who comes full fraught with an ardent deſire of receiving it, conſequently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts it, and yet notwithſtanding this offer and acceptation, he is deluded; for that power being Spiritual, and ſo inviſible, as is alſo the Character, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf impower'd to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and his Soul conſequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſht, with a new, and high Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, in plain and explicite words
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:101117:83"/>offered him, and yet is defrauded, and diſappointed of his expectation, for that Matter and Forme (as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by the ſecond part of the Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma) is not capable to confer upon him ſuch a dignity, notwithſtanding the Promiſe.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:101117:84"/>of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> the firſt by Conſecration in the Euchariſt; the ſecond by Relaxing, and Retaining ſins. There is alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon the Soul of the Ordained a Character, which is a Real Phyſical and Supernatural quality; neither is it Supernatural only <hi>quoad modum,</hi> in the circumſtances of producing it; but <hi>quoad entitatem,</hi> the very Intrinſecal Nature and Eſſence of it, is Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, becauſe no exigence of Nature can ever challenge it as due, in any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances whatſoever. From the ſame cauſe alſo proceeds an increaſe, of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying, and inherent Grace in the Soul of the Ordained, as alſo a plentiful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of Actual, and Tranſient Graces, whereby his Underſtanding is Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and his Will Fortified, in all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions conducing to the Functions of his Order, all which are, according to their Intrinſecal Nature, Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>And yet the cauſes from which theſe ſtrange effects proceed, are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves purely Natural, having no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to ſuch Supernatural products. They have only a Radical Obediential capacity, to be aſſumed, and elevated above their Nature, by the powerful
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:101117:84"/>hand of the Omnipotent, to produce, joyntly with him, any effect that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves not a contradiction. Thus the Natural Element of Water is Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to produce Spiritual and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Grace, and to deſtroy Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin. And in our preſent caſe, the Impoſition of Hands (though Natural in it ſelf) was appointed by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer to produce the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effects, waving the queſtion, whether the Cauſality of Sacraments be Phyſical, or only Moral, which the <hi>Divines</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
               <p>And as there is no power upon earth, that can abrogate, or alter <hi>Chriſts</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, or deveſt thoſe Natural Cauſes of that Efficacity, which by an Irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Decree, the Author of Grace hath given them, ſo there is no Created Power, neither <hi>Human</hi> nor <hi>Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> that can validly inſtitute, appoint, ordain, or determine any Natural Cauſe whatſoever, to produce any Supernatural effect, becauſe all Created Power, how great ſoever, is limited and confin'd within the bounds of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and ſo neither formally, nor vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, nor eminently, contains that Supereminent Vertue, or proportion
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:101117:85"/>with Supernatural Effects, which are far above its Sphear: How then can it Communicate to other Cauſes, that High Vertue, which it no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it ſelf? Hence it enſues, that as all the power of Nature, though it ſummon, and muſter up all its ſtrength, can never deprive thoſe Natural Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent Prerogative, nor hinder their effects, when duly applyed to Subjects capable, according to <hi>Chriſts</hi> Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo likewiſe, neither can it remove, or transfer this operative quality from thoſe cauſes, to which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixt it, and place it upon others of its own invention and determination. For no pure Creature, can alter, change, or abrogate a Divine Law; And in this caſe, the word Incarnate is the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or Law-giver, and therefore none but himſelf can make any Change in his own Law. Except Man, that is but a meer Creature, will wage War with his Creator, and Uſurp to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Power that never was, nor ever will be granted him, it being peculiar to God alone.</p>
               <p>The ground of this Doctrine is not New, but Admitted by All, and is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:101117:85"/>common to both Churches. For this is the Argument that St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> uſed againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who held a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in our Natural Acts to Merit Glory; and the <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> or <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilienſes,</hi> endeavouring a Moderation, attributed to our Natural Acts, a power of Meriting Supernatural Grace; and this obtained, rendered us capable of Meriting Glory. Which Opinions are both condemned as Heretical, chiefly upon this Principle, That whatſoever is Natural, hath no proportion, with things Supernatural; which common Reaſon dictates. Thus far in General: now we'll deſcend to Particulars.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion in agitation is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the touching the Veſſels, that is, the Chalice with Wine, and Water in it, and the Patene with an Hoaſt, be the Eſſential Matter and Forme of the Order of Prieſthood? I Aſſert that it is not, becauſe it was never aſſum'd nor appointed by the Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor for that end. This being a thing of Fact, muſt be made out by the Teſtimony of thoſe that beſt knew. None are more competent Witneſſes, nor were better acquainted with the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:101117:86"/>Tranſactions of <hi>Christ,</hi> then his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were eye-Witneſſes of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and to whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated ſuch things as chiefly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Church. And they have left their Teſtimony in Writing, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably obſerved in future times, and yet have no where left the leaſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Matter and Forme. If any ſuch thing had been Inſtituted by their Divine Maſter, it is moſt unlikely, and wholly incredible, that in a matter of ſuch moment, and high concern, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very being of the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, they ſhould have paſt it over in deep ſilence, and never have given the leſt intimation of it, neither in Word nor Writing, to thoſe of the Primitive Church, that immediately ſucceeded them. But ſo it is, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> never mention it; All Antiquity is wholly ignorant of it; ſearch all the Minuteſt Paſſages of Scripture, read all the Authors of the Infancy, and Growth of the Church, Examine all the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and Rituals of Ordination, the <hi>Latines, Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Syrian Maronites,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> the <hi>Eutichians,</hi> the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites,</hi> the <hi>Cophticks,</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> the <hi>Babilonians,</hi> the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> &amp;c. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:101117:86"/>all the Records of Councils, and you ſhall find nothing but a profound Silence, and Ignorance of any ſuch thing, till about 700 years ſince, as you may ſee above <hi>Section</hi> II. in the Ritual of <hi>Constantinus Caëtanus.</hi> In the Antient Rituals, as well of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and others, there is frequent mention made of the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands in Ordination, which was ever held Eſſential to the Order of Prieſthood, but of Touching the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels not a word. Whence we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that thoſe Veſſels were never Inſtituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> as the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Matter of Prieſthood, nor the Words annexed thereunto, as the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Forme. Let us now Collect what hath been proved in this <hi>Section:</hi> Nothing but that which <hi>Christ</hi> Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is the Eſſential Matter and Forme of the Order of Prieſthood; But <hi>Chriſt</hi> never Inſtituted the Touching of the Veſſels, and the words annexed to it; <hi>ergo,</hi> the Touching of the Veſſels, and the Words annexed to it, are not the Eſſential Matter, and Forme of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſthood; the Premiſes have been here clearly proved, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion is legally inferr'd.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:101117:87"/>
               <p>For a farther Proof of this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we muſt drive it a little higher, and conſider the fatal conſequences that would enſue from their Doctrine were it true. For if the Matter and Forme, ſpecifyed in the Title of this <hi>Section,</hi> be the Eſſentials of the Order of Prieſthood, then it inevitably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians diſperſt over all the <hi>East,</hi> yea, and the <hi>Latin</hi> Church alſo, for a Thouſand years after <hi>Christ,</hi> had never any Valid Ordination, becauſe they all wanted the Eſſentials of Prieſthood, for al theſe never made uſe of the Veſſels nor the Forme annexed to them, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by their Rituals (And to this day none but the <hi>Latines,</hi> ever applyed this Matter and Forme to him that was to be Ordained Prieſt) and therefore could have no True Patriarchs, not Biſhops, nor Prieſts among them. A very ſad Illation, and of vaſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; for no Prieſt, no Church What then, Muſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to keep up, and Maintain their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, which is a Meer Humane Invention, Un-Church all the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in the World for a Thouſand years together, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:101117:87"/>part of them to this day, and leave them deſtitute of either Biſhop or Prieſt? Where was, all this while, the provident care, that our great Maſter and Redeemer ever had of his Church, which he had Eſtabliſhed by the Price of his Precious Blood? Where was that tender love, that he ever teſtified to his Endear'd Spouſe? Could heabandon his whole Church ſo ſoon after he had Inſtituted, and ſo firmly Founded it, that the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt it? What Chriſtian can, without a Sacred Horror, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a thought, of ſuch a general devaſtation, and deplorable deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>But this being ſo obvious, could not but work the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> into an anxiety and ſedulous indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to find a remedy; wherefore, to ſalve this Sore, they would never Reordain their Proſelites, that had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the Communion of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and imbraced theirs; but on the contrary, in all occaſions, declared the Ordinations of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church to be valid; and conſequently grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to thoſe <hi>Greeks,</hi> that were now In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into their Church, the free
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:101117:88"/>uſe of all their Prieſtly Functions (though they had been created Prieſts according to the Rites of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church) and never attempted to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordain them. By this they endeavor to evade this laſt imputation, which otherwiſe would lye heavy upon them.</p>
               <p>But in plain terms, this evaaſion is no better, then a meer contradiction; for, How is it poſſible that the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>Greeks</hi> could be valid, without the Eſſentials of Ordination? which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church placeth in the Touching of the Holy Veſſels, with this Forme, <hi>Accipe poteſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. Receive a power to offer Sacrifice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe the <hi>Greeks</hi> never uſed. You were as good tell me, That one may be truly and properly a Man, without either Body, or Reaſonable Soul, which are the Eſſentials of Man.</p>
               <p>If you ſhould Reply, That there may be Two Eſſences of Ordination, ſo that each taken apart from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, makes the Ordination valid. So when the <hi>Greeks</hi> Ordain, they uſe for Matter, the Impoſition of Hands, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:101117:88"/>for Forme, theſe words, <hi>Divina gratia,</hi> &amp;c. <q>The Divine Grace, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways heals that which is infirm, and ſupplies that which is defective, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes this moſt holy Deacon to be a Prieſt.</q> By this Matter and Forme, the <hi>Greeks</hi> do validly confer the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſthood: And when the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> Ordain, they do the like by their peculiar Matter and Forme. So that neither is rigorouſly neceſſary, but either may ſuffice. This Doctrine is very Paradoxical, for in ſubſtance it aſſerts, that one and the ſame thing may have two compleat and adequate Eſſences, ſpecifically, and generically different from each other, which is impoſſible, for a thing, and his ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Eſſence is the ſame, and nothing can be ſpecifically, or generically dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from its ſelf.</p>
               <p>But you'l ſay, Theſe are not two Eſſences of the ſame thing, but two different cauſes of the ſame effect. To ſolve this, I muſt diſtinguiſh between the Order it ſelf, and the Ordination; the Order is that Spiritual Power, which is given to the Ordained, by vertue of his Ordination, from whence
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:101117:89"/>reſults the Order, together with its concomitant Supernatural effects, which are the Character and Sacramental Graces, that are inſeparable from it. The Ordination is made up of thoſe Actions and Words, which the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer exerciſeth, and applyeth to the Ordained, ſo that the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on participates more of the nature of a cauſality, then of a cauſe. And the whole Eſſence of this Ordination, is the Matter and Forme inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for whatſoever was aſſum'd by the Original Inſtituter, and by him elevated, and impower'd to produce ſuch admirable, ſupernatural, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental effects, is the Eſſence of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; So that Order is the Effect, and Ordination the Cauſe: wherefore, if you appoint new Eſſentials of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, you not only grant two Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the ſame effect, but two Eſſences of the ſame thing, whereby you render Ordination, ſpecifically, and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially diſtinct from its ſelf. And becauſe none but an Omnipotent Power, can raiſe Natural Cauſes to ſuch vigor and energy, as to produce ſuch extraordinary effects; therefore that Matter and Forme which <hi>Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:101117:89"/>hath Inſtituted to this end, is the total Eſſence of Ordination. And herein the <hi>Greeks</hi> have the advantage, for they ever uſed the Impoſition of Hands, with the Forme above mentioned; which the Primitive Church received from the Apoſtles, and they from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo the <hi>Greeks</hi> are ſure, that their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath a legal and valid Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But where ſhall we find another adequate Eſſence of Ordination, by Divine Inſtitution? That of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath no ſuch Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, for we know its Origine, and have ſcan'd its Pedigree, whereby we find, that there is nothing but Human Autority to authoriſe it, which hath no proportion to ſuch wonderful effects which are out of the reach of Nature, and none but an Omnipotent Power can produce. Hence we ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly conclude, that there is but one valid Ordination, which hath but one certain, and determinate Nature, and Eſſence, neither is there any power upon Earth that can add to it, or take from it. So that in vain you aſſign the Touching of the Veſſels, with its Forme, for a ſecond, total, and adequate Eſſence of Ordination.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101117:90"/>For all Antiquity was a ſtranger to this, the <hi>Apostles</hi> never heard of it, <hi>Chriſt</hi> never mentioned it neither by word nor action. Who then dares obtrude this as belonging to the Eſſence of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, which is of Divine Right, as all Sacraments are? Certainly none will attempt it, but ſuch whoſe ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion prompts them to intrench upon Divine Right, and God it here upon Earth, not knowing, or not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that their power is limited, and confin'd within its certain bounds.</p>
               <p>Beſides, were there two Formes of Ordination, one Inſtituted by Divine Autority, the other by Human, and both valid; by the ſame Rule you might inſtitute Two hundred, yea, every Dioceſs might have one peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to it ſelf; there is no more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Third, then there was for the Second, nor for the Fourth, then the Third, and ſo of all the reſt. Wherefore if ſuch a power were dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to meer Humanes, What a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion might they bring into the Church? which would be the ground of Diſcord, and Diſſention, for one Biſhop might contend with another, whoſe Ordination was beſt.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:101117:90"/>
               <p>Having thus proved the <hi>Invalidity of Ordination,</hi> according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> and General Approbation of that Church; I ſhall now imploy my endeavors to ſolve the Objections which may be propoſed in vindication thereof.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Roman</hi> Divines, who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavor to compoſe this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, find ſo much arduity in it, that they cannot agree among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but what expedient one finds out, as accommodated to this end, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſapproves, and ſo with great anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, they caſt about, by ſeveral wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and turnings, to compoſe the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between both Churches; but, in the execution, they impugne each other, and, by this means, divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into ſeveral Claſſes. Whereof I ſhall here give you an account.</p>
               <p>The moſt conſiderable Party, as well for number, as for autority and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, are thoſe who abſolutely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all Impoſition of Hands, from the Eſſentials of Ordination, and place the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:101117:91"/>whole Eſſence thereof in Touching the Holy Veſſels, with the Forme accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated thereunto. And indeed, this is generally received in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as an undoubted Truth,<note place="margin">Some of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I have cited in the <hi>Fourth Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
                  </note> and practiſed as ſuch. This is conformable to the Doctrine of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 9th, which I have cited in the beginning of the Fourth <hi>Section.</hi> This Opinion needs no Anſwer, for the Authors here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſo far from reconciling both Churches, that they Unchurch both: and in ſtead of ſolving the difficulty, they ſink under the burthen thereof. They deſtroy the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Impoſition of Hands to be Eſſential to Ordination, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> ever uſed as the only Eſſential Matter thereof. They deſtroy the <hi>Latines,</hi> by relying wholly upon the Touching of the Veſſels, and the Forme annexed, as the only Eſſential Matter and Forme of Ordination, excluding all other, and yet this Matter and Forme are wholly uncapable of giving any validity to the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, becauſe they want the Eſſence, the very life and ſoul of being Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to Ordination, which is the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:101117:92"/>Divine Inſtitution, as I have manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved in the precedent <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Second Objection: The Divine Inſtitutor of the Order of Prieſthood, did not determine the ſpecifical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Forme thereof, but only in general, that the Church ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ſome ſenſible Matter, and ſome Forme of Words, whereby to ſignifie the collation of Order by their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So that here is a latitude in <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution, and a Power left to the Church to determine what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Matter and Forme, ſhe ſhould think fit, and by this Power the Church may alter the Matter and Forme of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at her pleaſure; ſhe may abrogate what was before in uſe, and Inſtitute a new Matter and Forme, and the Order will ſtill be valid. So <hi>Iſam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,</hi> the Kings Profeſſor of <hi>Divinity</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> Treating at large of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Order, <hi>Diſput.</hi> 3. <hi>art.</hi> 3. his words are theſe; <hi>Chriſtus Dominus instituendo Ordines, determinavit tantum eorum materias in genere, nimirum, ut ea eſſet legitima cujuſlibet Ordinis mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, quae exiſtens ſenſibilis, ſui Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione debitè &amp; ſufficienter facta, tam ex
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:101117:92"/>parte Miniſtri, quam intentionis, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaret tune de facto poteſtatem tali Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dini propriam dari ei qui materiam iſtam ſenſibilem, ſeu ſignum istud ſenſibile, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciperet in ſua Ordinatione; particularem autem istius ſigni determinationem, ſeu imponere, &amp; veluti affigere ſignificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem practicam illius poteſtatis, huic vel illi rei ſenſibili in particulari reliquit faciendum Eccleſiae, prout, &amp; quando illa judicaret eſſe conveniens. Our Lord</hi> Chriſt <hi>Instituting Orders, did only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their Matter in General, which being ſenſible, duly and ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, as well in reference to the Minister, as the Intention, might ſignifie then in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, the power proper to that Order to be given to him, that in his Ordination ſhould receive this ſenſible Matter, or Sign. But to determine this Sign in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to Impoſe, and as it were affix to it a Practical Signification of that Power given to this or that Senſible Thing in Particular, he hath left to be done by the Church, when, and how ſhe ſhould judge it convenient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And having Proved out of the <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions</hi> of <hi>Clement,</hi> and the <hi>Fourth Council</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> That the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:101117:93"/>of Hands by the Biſhop, and the aſſiſting Prieſts uſed in the beginning of Ordination, was formerly the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Matter of Prieſthood, he adds, <hi>Igitur cum hoc noſtro tempore, haec Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio manuum ſit tantum accidentalis; &amp; illa poſterior, quae fit à ſolo Epiſcopo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul dicente ei quem Ordinat; Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, Quorum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſit nunc Eſſentialis, ut ſupra oſtendimus, aliqua mutatio eſt facta per Eccleſiam in iſta materia Ordinum. Therefore, ſince in this our time, this Impoſition of Hands is only accidental, and that last which is performed, only by the Biſhop, ſaying to him whom he Ordains,</hi> 
                  <q>Receive the Holy Ghoſt: whoſe ſins,</q> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. is Eſſential, as I have ſhewn above, ſome change is made by the Church in this matter of Orders.</hi> Thus he.

               <p>There are Three Reaſons that this Objection is grounded on.<note place="margin">Lugo D <hi>2.</hi> de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis in genere, S. <hi>5.</hi> n. <hi>85.</hi>
                  </note> The firſt is, becauſe the Church hath changed the matter of Subdeaconſhip, which was formerly conferr'd by the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:101117:93"/>of Hands, but now by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Practiſe of the Church, that Impoſition of Hands doth not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Eſſence of Subdeaconſhip. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Clandeſtine Marriage was ever valid before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> but now is rendred invalid by that Council. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Impoſition of Hands with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Unction; but now, if the Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be omitted, the Confirmation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid.</p>
               <p>To this Objection, my firſt Anſwer is, That it is all <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> it is ſaid without ground. It is <hi>mera petitio principii.</hi> They aſſume for proofe that which is to be proved. The thing in queſtion is, Whether the Church hath Power to Repeal, Alter, or Change, that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Inſtituted in matter of Ordination? This Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contends, that the Church hath done it, in Ordination, Matrimony, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation. I grant, the Church hath done it <hi>de Facto,</hi> but not <hi>de Jure:</hi> That is, it hath by its Ordination, and Practiſe, endeavored to violate Divine Right, but neither legally nor validly, as we have already proved. It is not that which is done at <hi>Rome,</hi> that muſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:101117:94"/>Regulate our Belief, but that which is well and regularly done. So <hi>Duran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, in</hi> 4. <hi>diſt.</hi> 13. <hi>q.</hi> 3. telling us, That the cuſtom of the Prieſt-Cardinals, joyntly Celebrating with the Pope, was not in his time obſerved. <hi>Et ſi obſervarctur, non eſſet neceſſarium crede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re quod benè fieret, quia ſecundùm Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimum, non quod fit Romae, ſed quod ſieri debet, attendendum eſt.</hi> And if that cuſtom ſhould be obſerved at <hi>Rome,</hi> it would not be neceſſary to believe, that it were well done; for according to <hi>Hierome:</hi> not that which is done at <hi>Rome,</hi> but that which ought to be done, muſt be obſerved, ſaith <hi>Durand.</hi> As for Subdeaconſhip, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and Confirmation, they all contain the ſame difficulty with this. Certain it is, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (as much as in her lies) hath made a change in the Matter and Forme of her pretended Sacraments; and as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that ſhe hath done it illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and invalidly, as having No power, autority, or commiſſion to alter, change, or abrogate the Conſtitutions of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which are of Divine Right, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in our caſe, where meer Natural Creatures are elevated to produce ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:101117:94"/>effects, which is peculiar to an Omnipotent Power, as is clearly proved in the precedent <hi>Section.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Second Anſwer is, That accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Doctrine of this Objection, we muſt admit in the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, confus'd and imperfect acts, ſuch are thoſe which repreſent Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, or Objects in General, which the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſale;</hi> and by ſuch Acts a Created Underſtanding: <hi>cognoſcit plura non cognita pluralitate;</hi> that is, an Act of Human Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, repreſents a nature common to Many, but doth not repreſent the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, nor the differences between them, and ſo by a diſtinction made by the Underſtanding, that Metaphyſical formality which is common to many, is ſeparated, and diſtinguiſht from the difference that is between them, and yet they are really identify'd; this is proper to Human Underſtanding, and to Angelical, in ſuch Objects as Angels know by forrain ſpecies, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, but not in thoſe that are known by their proper ſpecies, becauſe theſe ſpecies produce perfect acts, that repreſent the Object as it is, which, of it ſelf, admits no ſuch diſtinction, but
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:101117:95"/>is indiviſible. Now, to attribute to God ſuch confuſed, abſtractive, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect notions of Objects, is to deſtroy his Omniſcience, which can admit of no imperfection, and ſo conſequently this Doctrine would Ungod him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Divine Intellect hath for its Object, all thoſe particulars, with all their niceſt differences, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under thoſe heads that we call Generals, all which he repreſents, as they are in themſelves, with all their differences, by a cleer intuitive, and comprehenſive act. The reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God uſeth no ſpecies, no, nor acts diſtinct from himſelf; his Eſſence is his act, and ſpecies alſo, which hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to all things that are poſſible, and hence he perfectly comprehends them all in their particulars and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, and therefore cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a general praedicate ſo as to preſcind it from the differential formality, for this would argue imperfection. Now ſince the Will of God is regulated by his underſtanding, he can make no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by way of Inſtitution of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to elevate ſuch or ſuch ſenſible ſigns in general, to produce ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effects, except he fixeth it upon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:101117:95"/>ſome determinate particulars, becauſe the Underſtanding repreſents no ſuch generals, without the determinate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular differences, for <hi>nihil volitum quin praecognitum,</hi> the Will can have no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but what the Underſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents; the Underſtanding of God repreſents no General without particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, therefore the Will cannot decree an extraordinary concurſe to a General without determining the particulars; for otherwiſe God would determine himſelf, by his Decree, to give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary concurſe to he knew not what, but the Church muſt afterwards determine him; which is a conceit very unworthy of the infinite perfection of Gods Underſtanding and Will. Hence it is manifeſt, that the Matter and Forme of Sacraments can never be capacita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to produce ſuch wonderful and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural effects, except the Divine Decree paſs upon them in particular, to enable them to it, by his concomitant and extraordinary aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>But it may be alleaged, that without affiixing any obſcurity or imperfection to the Divine Acts, a Power may be left to the Church to determine ſome
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:101117:96"/>one of thoſe matters, which the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God repreſents diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with all their particular differences, and Regulates his Decree by the Churches Determination.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That in effect this is no other then to Aſſert, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Commiſſion'd the Church to Inſtitute Sacraments; for here are no limits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but they are left to the whole latitude of any ſenſible Matter. And I demand, Whether any Divine dare aſſert, That the Church hath Power to change the Eſſential Matter of Baptiſm, or Euchariſt, for any other ſpecifically diſtinct from what is now in uſe? if not, What ground is there to aſſert ſuch a Power in the Church, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to one Sacrament more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Beſides, in this particular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Inſtituting Sacraments, ſuch a ſubordination of Gods Decrees to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man determination, derogates from the dignity of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Redeemer, for he alone, without any Human Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is the Sole Inſtitutor of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who, without Mans help, hath perfected the Work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:101117:96"/>
               <p>My third Anſwer is, That according to this Doctrine, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would have a power to Inſtitute Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the Eſſence of each Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſiſts preciſely in the Matter and Forme, ſo that the Inſtitutor muſt appoint and determine what ſhall be the Matter and Forme of each Sacrament, which in effect is nothing elſe but the Sacrament it ſelf, which conſiſts only of theſe two Eſſential parts, impowered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch effects as are peculiar to each Sacrament. But you will ſay, It is not the Church but <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that enables them to produce the Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effects, by the Churches determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is well that the Church will admit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to be a Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuter with it; but yet the Church ſtill retains the <hi>rectum,</hi> which is the viſible, or ſenſible ſign, and contains the whole Eſſence of the Sacrament, and leaves to <hi>Chriſt</hi> only the <hi>obliquum,</hi> which is to do the work intended by it. But where was this Divinity ever Taught, to ſeparate the parts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Sacraments, ſo as that one part ſhould be Human, and the other
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:101117:97"/>Divine? which ſtill makes the Church a joynt Inſtitutor with <hi>Christ,</hi> and ſo, as that the Church hath the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hand in it, for the Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Appoints, and Determines all, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> is to be ready at the Churches beck, to execute what ſhe appoints; as though the Omnipotent Power of the Divine Word were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the Church: for it is the powerful hand of <hi>Christ</hi> that elevates the ſenſible Signs to produce Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental effects, which are out of the reach of nature. But the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines what the Signs ſhall be, and ſummons the Divine Words Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, when and where to elevate them, and ſo ſhe hath the greateſt ſhare in the Inſtitution of Sacraments. 'Tis ſtrange, how ſuch a Thought could find admittance into any true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians underſtanding, to deveſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> of this Prerogative, and give it the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates from the high Power and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Incarnate Word.</p>

De traditione autem calicis &amp; hostiae, nulla eſt mentio apud illos. Tertiò, quia videtur durum nimis eſſe, ceremoniam quam nobis perſpicuè tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt Apostoli, excludere à natura Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenti, &amp; inducere illam, de qua nulla mentio fit in Scriptura.</hi> In En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Impoſition of hands is not to be eſteemed, as a Ceremony, not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but as an Eſſential part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and this ought to be held as an Article of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe in Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever mention is made of Ordination,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:101117:99"/>it is declar'd by the Impoſition of hands; and it ſeems to me temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, to deſert the Scripture, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Fictions, that is, Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>Becauſe it is evident by all Antient Writers, that the Primitive Church never Ordained without the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands; but they make no mention of delivering the Chalice and the Hoaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly. <hi>Becauſe it ſeems too hard to exclude from the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a Ceremony, which is clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us by the Apostles, and, to induce that, of which there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made in the Scripture.</hi> Thus <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donatus.</hi>

               <p>'Tis well that ſome of our Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts cannot be ſwayed neither by hope nor fear, nor any way deterr'd from uttering Truth. He tells us, That it is an Article of Faith, that the Impoſition of hands is Eſſential to Ordination, and that it is a temerity to deny it, and he proves both by

               <p>A Third Objection endeavors a Reconciliation, by joyning the delivery of the Inſtruments or Veſſels, and their Forme, with the laſt Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, and this Forme, <hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> &amp;c. So that of theſe two Matters they make one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Matter; and of theſe two Forms, they frame one entire and adequate Forme. Yet ſo, as that by touching the Veſſels with this Forme, <hi>Accipe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtatem,</hi> &amp;c. they affirm the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive the Order of Prieſthood, with Power to Conſecrate and offer Sacrifice; and the Character to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by imprinted. But by the conſequent impoſition of hands, the Ordained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Power only to forgive or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſins, as the Forme of words expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. So <hi>Becanus, Part</hi> 3. <hi>Theologiae, Cap.</hi> 26. <hi>de Sacramento Ordinis, queſt.</hi> 4. who uſes his utmoſt endeavor by this means, to maintain the Validity
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:101117:101"/>of Ordination according to the preſent practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet ſo, as not to draw any prejudice upon the Ordination of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and other Chriſtian Congregations, whoſe Ordinations the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever declared valid. But the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> ſeems to obſtruct his deſign, by aſſigning no other Eſſentials of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination but the Tradition of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and their Forme, and here <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus,</hi> above cited, in the precedent <hi>Section, Cap.</hi> 4. joyns his forces with <hi>Becanus,</hi> or rather <hi>Becanus</hi> with him. So alſo doth <hi>Meratius, D</hi> 7. <hi>S.</hi> 2. who, to the Autority of the Council of <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> Anſwers; <hi>Concilium non ſuſcepiſſe ex profeſſo declarandum accurate ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum ordinum, materiam &amp; formam to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talem ac integram,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſed ſolum per cujus rei Traditionem poteſtas ordinis conferetur. The Council</hi> (ſaith <hi>Merati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) <hi>did not undertake of purpoſe, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare exactly, the total and adequate Matter and Forme of each order,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but only to declare what thoſe things were by whoſe Tradition the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was conferr'd.</hi> And this Opinion <hi>Iſamberus</hi> alſo imbraces with avidity, as conceiving all helps little enough,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:101117:101"/>in ſuch a hard conjuncture, and therfore joyns this Opinion with his own, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd above in the Second Objection. St. <hi>Bonaventure</hi> holds the ſame, in 4 <hi>d.</hi> 7. <hi>ar.</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. and before him <hi>Alexander, p.</hi> 4. <hi>Summe. q.</hi> 9. <hi>Memb.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>ar.</hi> 2. where he diſtinguiſheth between that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Ordained, and that which the Church Ordained, in theſe words, <hi>Quae enim ab homine Ordinata ſunt, ab homine poſſunt mutari, quae autem à Deo inſtituta ſunt, non niſi dictante Deo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent mutari. Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are Ordained by Man, may be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Man, but thoſe things that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by God, are not to be changed, but by Gods appointment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to their Interpretation of the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> I Anſwer, That it is is a meer ungrounded ſhift, for the Council gives not the leaſt hint of any ſuch ſenſe, but undertakes to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign the Eſſential matter of Prieſthood, and to that purpoſe, ſpecifies only the Tradition of the Veſſels, as the only Eſſential Matter, and mentions nothing elſe, which would be a meer deluſion, if the Council had judged any thing elſe to be Eſſential. But <hi>Becanus</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets it thus, <hi>Nota, antiqua Concilia
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:101117:102"/>aſſignaſſe materiam à Chriſto Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam; Florentinum verò materiam aſſignaſſe quam Eccleſia introduxit. Note</hi> (ſaith <hi>Becanus</hi>) <hi>that the Antient Councils aſſigned the matter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt; but the Council of</hi> Florence <hi>ſpecified the Matter that was introduced by the Church.</hi> Be it ſo; then the Antient Councils aſſigned only the Impoſition of hands, as the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Matter of Prieſthood; but the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> in the time of thoſe Fathers, ſignified the Tradition of the Veſſels, and nothing elſe, as the only Eſſential Matter: So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Antient, nor Modern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, ever joyned theſe two Matters together, as parts of the whole, by their own Confeſſion. But hence it is plain, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath introduced a New Matter and Forme, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> never Inſtituted, and yet they hold it Eſſential. Now to their Argument.</p>
               <p>My firſt Anſwer is, That this is a meer evaſion to ſave them from Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. What ground have they, for patching up a Sacramental Matter with two ſuch diſparate, and heterogeneal
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101117:102"/>pieces? What time will they appoint to have the Character imprinted? What will this avail them, if it ſhould be all granted; for none of them will admit the Impoſition of Hands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, with its Forme, to have a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity to confer the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and Imprint the Character, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt declare the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Greeks</hi> to be fruſtrate, who never uſed any other Matter then the Impoſition of Hands. But if this alone be ſufficient, Then what need is there of the Tradition of the Veſſels? Why ſhould theſe two parts, ſo different from each other, be conjoyned, if either of them apart were ſufficient?</p>
               <p>My Second Anſwer is; That they could never have made a worſe choice then to joyn theſe two Matters and Formes together, in order to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the entire Eſſence of Ordination; for both the one and the other are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations; the one begun about Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred years ſince; the other was introduced about Four hundred and fifty years ſince; ſo that neither was Inſtituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> neither
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:101117:103"/>practiſed in the Church of God before the times ſpecified. From whence then can they derive their Validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
               <p>My Third Anſwer is, That the laſt Impoſition of Hands with this Forme, <hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Receive the Holy Ghoſt; whoſe ſins you forgive they are forgiven, whoſe ſins you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, they are retained.</hi> This, I ſay, can no way belong to the Eſſentials of Prieſthood, becauſe this Matter and Forme are applyed to none but thoſe that have before received the Order of Prieſthood, and have the Character Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, which is manifeſt, becauſe they all ſaid Maſs, and Conſecrated with the Biſhop, before the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Matter and Forme, which is not performed till after they have all Received the Communion, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before the Poſt-Communion is Read; wherefore this Matter and Forme comes too late, to have any influence upon the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; but I ſhall not need ſpend time in the Proof of this; becauſe the Authors of this Objection grant it, and only make uſe of this Matter and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:101117:103"/>Forme, to confer the Power of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving and Retaining ſins. Which being ſuppoſed, they muſt rely whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Tradition of the Veſſels, for conferring upon the Ordained the Spiritual Power of Prieſthood, and enabling him to Conſecrate the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and for Imprinting the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which, the touching of the Veſſels, with its Forme, can never accompliſh, becauſe here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, no Impoſition of Hands doth any way concur to this. So that we have here the Power of Prieſthood conferr'd, with the Character, and yet without any Impoſition of Hands; and hereby this Opinion agrees with the Firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, which excludes all Impoſition of Hands; and therefore muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity condemn the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, who never uſe any other Matter of Ordination, then the Impoſition of Hands. And yet the main drift of theſe Objections is, to ſave the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the <hi>Greeks</hi> Ordinations, ſo as not to deſtroy their own. And that the Power of Conſecrating the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the Principal
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:101117:104"/>Act of Prieſthood, they all grant, and it is ſo aſſerted by <hi>Albertus Magnus. The Act of Prieſts</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Body and Blood of</hi> Chriſt:<note place="margin">Albert. Mag.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>and it is the Principal Act; the other is conſequent, which is, to Retain and Abſolve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Fourth Objection: Nothing can be more ſignificant, nor more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Function and chief Miniſtry of a Prieſt, then the delivering to him, in his Ordination, thoſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels wherein he is to Conſecrate, and Conſummate the Myſteries of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, which is the Principal and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Act of his Prieſtly Office; and therefore nothing ſo fit, to be the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Matter of his Ordination. So likewiſe the Forme, clearly, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely ſignifieth the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to be conferr'd to the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the application of this Matter and Forme, and therefore is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly accommodated to this preſent end.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That it argues Temerity and Preſumption, for meer Men to prefer their judgments before the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:101117:104"/>of the Word Incarnate, who knows and comprehends all things whoſe judgment and prudence is infi, nite, and conſequently he beſt knew what was moſt ſignificant, and moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the Matter and Forme of ſuch Myſteries, as he himſelf Inſtituted. And therefore, to reject that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> appointed, and ſubſtitute in lieu thereof the products of our own weak invention, under pretence that it is more accommodated to the Myſtery then that, is too high an attempt, for hereby we deveſt <hi>Christ</hi> of his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, and conſequently of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, by preferring our own Finite and Limited capacities, before the II-limited Perfections of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is very prepoſterous and deordinate.</p>
               <p>As to the Forme of words which they have introduced, to animate their adventitious Matter, leſt their Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſhould remain incompleate: I Anſwer, That this Modern Forme, now in practice in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to wit, <hi>Receive a Power of offering Sacrifice as well for the Living as the Dead,</hi> &amp;c. is very different from the antient Forme
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:101117:105"/>derived from the Apoſtles, which is this, <hi>The Divine Grace, which always heals that which is infirm, and ſupplies that which is defective, promotes this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Deacon to be a Prieſt.</hi> Compare theſe two together, and you will find a ſubſtantial difference between them, that is Imperative, this Indicative; that gives Power of offering Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; this hath no ſuch expreſſion: That ſpecifies to whoſe benefit the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice ſhall accrue; this makes no mention at all to whoſe benefit it ſhould redound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther differences make thoſe two Forms very heterogeneal, and diſcrepating, when compared with each other.</p>
               <p>But it may be alleag'd, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe ſeeming Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet, in effect, the two Forms are equivalent, and render the ſame ſenſe, only with this difference, that what the one contains implicitely, the other expreſſeth more particularly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely. The ſecond ſignifies Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood conferr'd, which implies a power of exerciſing all the Functions and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries that properly belong to a Prieſt; among which is enumerated the power
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:101117:105"/>of offering Sacrifice, which peculiarly belongs to a Prieſt. This therefore is tacitly contained, and involved under the ſignification of this Second Forme; and the firſt ſignifies more diſtinctly this ſelf-ſame thing, and no more. For the intention of the Sacrificator, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecal to the Sacrifice, for whether he offer it for the Living, or the Dead, or by way of Satisfaction, Propitiation, or Impetration for himſelf, or others, makes no change in the Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>This latter part I admit: but, to the reſt I Anſwer, That the offering of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the Law of Grace, is not the only Function peculiar and proper to a Prieſt, becauſe the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, Preaching, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the Word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Miniſteries belonging to the Office of Prieſts: all which are contained under the Second Forme, but wholly omitted in the Firſt, which only impowers the Ordained to offer Sacrifice, and limits his power to this alone, becauſe this Power is explicitely given him, and no mention made of any other; ſo that the Second Forme having a greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as comprehending all that is
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:101117:106"/>contained under the notion of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the Firſt Forme limited to one Function alone, it is manifeſt that this Firſt Forme, <hi>peccat per defectum,</hi> that it is deficient, for it doth not reach the compleate Power of Prieſthood, and the Second Forme being wholly omitted in the <hi>Roman Pontifical,</hi> the Ordination conſequently is Eſſentially defective.</p>
               <p>Yet Independent of all this, they acknowledging the Original Matter and Forme to be valid: What neceſſity was there of Inſtituting this New Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Forme? Is it Chriſtian-like to be diffident of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Providence? as though the Supreame Power of our Benign Redeemer wanted Ability, or his Omniſcience were defective to know our wants; or his Infinite Goodneſs had not the Will to furniſh us with all neceſſaries conducing to our Eternal Bliſs. Is it poſſible that any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though but meanly inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Reaſon, can conceive, that Human Providence, in theſe Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Myſteries, can, in the leaſt manner, come in competition with that never failing Providence of <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf? They Teach, That the Matter and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:101117:106"/>Forme of all Sacraments, are ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd by Divine Inſtitution,<note place="margin">Bellarm. L. <hi>1.</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram. in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, C. <hi>21.</hi>

                  <hi>ut non li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat quidquam immutare,</hi> that it is not lawful to change any thing, ſaith <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine;</hi> and <hi>Suarez</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith.</hi> See the <hi>Authors,</hi> for this, above, <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. in the Fourth Anſwer to the Second Objection; they alſo hold Ordination to be a Sacrament: <hi>Si quis dixerit Ordinem ſive Sacram Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinationem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trident. Seſſ. <hi>23.</hi> Can. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>non eſſe verè &amp; propriè Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum, à Christo Domino Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anathema ſit.</hi> If any one ſhall ſay, That Order, or Ordination is not truely and properly a Sacrament, Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Lord, let him be Accurſed, ſaith the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> If therefore they ſtand to their own Principles, the change which they have made, in the Matter and Forme of Ordination, can be no leſs then a violation of Divine Right, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Order of Prieſthood Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; for though their Modern Forme ſhould be equivalent to the Primitive Forme, yet if it be miſplaced, and not applyed to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, which is the Original Matter, it cannot make one with it; and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:101117:107"/>ſo on this account, the Ordination will be Invalid. And in effect they have ſo diſmembred the parts of <hi>Christ</hi>'s In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and ſo inverted the Order of them, that it is very remote from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing it was. For though they uſe the Impoſition of Hands (which is the Original Matter) yet they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply not to it, the Original Forme, which they entirely omit; nay, they allow it no Forme at all, as it were in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; the Ordainer, with Deep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence only putting his hand upon the Head of him that is to be Ordained, not deeming it an Eſſential Matter of Order, but only as a preparative there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And the Second Impoſition of Hands (which immediately follows the Firſt) hath no Forme, but a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, neither can it confer the Order of Prieſthood, becauſe the Forme which follows at a diſtance, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Tradition of the Veſſels, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſignifies the Order then given, which would be a Sacrilegious Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, were it given before. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Antient Forme being omitted, and the new one not applyed to the Original Matter, I conclude, that here is made an Eſſential Mutation deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:101117:107"/>of the Validity of Order.</p>
               <p>A Fifth Objection, much like the former, is propoſed by his Eminence, Cardinal <hi>Lugo,</hi> who diſapproving all other ways of reconciling the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, in matter of Ordination, propoſeth, as he conceives, a better expedient, in theſe words, <hi>Verior ergo, &amp; planior concili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andi modus eſt, quam ſupra inſinuavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mm:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lugo. D. <hi>2.</hi> de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cram in genere, S. <hi>5.</hi> n. <hi>98.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Eccleſiam Latinam retinuiſſe uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que, priſcum illum ritum ab Apoſtolis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductum, Ordinandi Sacerdotem per manus Impoſitionem, illam tamen mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam magis explicitam reddidiſſe, adjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendo traditionem panis &amp; vini quod Graeci non faciunt; ita ut ex manus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitione, &amp; Traditione panis &amp; vini, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at una integra materia magis explicita, cum forma quae nunc profertur explican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te potestatem ſolam ad ſacrificândum. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtea vero adhibetur iterum alia manus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio cum altera forma explicante poteſtatem ad Abſolvendum. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a truer and a plainer way of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is that which we have inſinuated above, that the</hi> Latin <hi>Church hath indeed retained the Antient Rite introduced by the Apoſtles, of Ordaining a Priest by the Impoſition of Hands, but hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:101117:108"/>it more explicite, by adding to it the Tradition of Bread and Wine, which the</hi> Greeks <hi>do not practiſe; ſo that of the Impoſition of Hands, and Tradition of the Bread and Wine, there is made one entire Matter more explicite, with the Forme now in uſe, that expreſſeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a power of Sacriſicing. But afterwards there follows another Impoſition of Hands, with another Forme, expreſſing the Power of Abſolving.</hi> Thus Cardinal <hi>Lugo.</hi> The ſame is held by <hi>Gravina. De ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria &amp; forma Ordinis. D.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. where he ſaith, That the Veſſels are implicitely contained in the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands, wherefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> do implicitely, and virtually touch the Veſſels, but the <hi>Latins</hi> do it explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and formally.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That the ſo much deſired Reconciliation between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the <hi>Latines,</hi> in reference to Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will never be made, by the Doctrine of this Objection, which is grounded upon a falſe Principle, that the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Veſſels is equivalently the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, and ſo virtually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, which is repugnant to common ſenſe. For, What have the Veſſels to do with the Impoſition of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:101117:108"/>Hands? What analogy or ſimilitude is there between them? The Impoſition of Hands being the Action of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer, wherein the Ordained is but paſſively concerned. And the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Veſſels is the proper Action of the Ordained. Now to prove the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them, we muſt have recourſe to the <hi>ſpecificativa entium,</hi> as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> terme it; that is, by aſſigning the termes or correlatives, of their intrinſecal and Eſſential Relations, we may evidently deduce, what their Nature and Eſſence is. The Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Veſſels is an action, whoſe origine and cauſe, is the Perſon of the Ordained. The Object or Term of the ſame action, is the Thing Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which are the Veſſels. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, hath for its origine or cauſe, the Perſon of the Biſhop, who is the Ordainer; and for its object, or terme, the Perſon of the Ordained; ſo that the correlatives of the one, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the correlatives of the other, are as different, as the Veſſels are from the Perſon of the Ordained; and from this difference we evidently gather the like difference between the Touching the Veſſels, and the Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:101117:109"/>of Hands, by reaſon of the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal, and Eſſential habitude, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which theſe actions have to their correlatives. But the Eſſence of the Veſſels, and the Perſon of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, are not only ſpecifically, but generically different from each other, the one being an Animate Creature, the principle of Vegetation, Senſation and Reaſon; the other only Inanimate Metals, deſtitute of Life, Vegetation, Senſation and Reaſon; which by the firſt notions of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> argues a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical, and generical difference. And conſequently the Impoſition of Hands, and touching the Veſſels, are Eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and Subſtantially different from each other. And by this Diſcourſe, the ſame difference will reſult, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you inſiſt upon the Veſſels, or the Subſtance of Bread and Wine, which they contain, for they are all Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and deſtitute of Life. So that the Touching of the Veſſels, and the Impoſition of Hands, are Eſſentially, and Subſtantially diſtinguiſht from each other, and conſequently the one can neither formally, nor virtually, nor equivalently, nor implicitly, contain the other.</p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:101117:109"/>
               <p>And yet that the Order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is a Sacrament, we have their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conſent; The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> defines it,<note place="margin">Tred. Seſs. <hi>23.</hi> Can. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> to be truely and properly a Sacrament Inſtituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and layes a Curſe upon thoſe that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it, as we ſee above. What then remains? but that in the Eſſentials of an acknowledg'd Sacrament, Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they have made a ſubſtantial and Eſſential Mutation. And yet they cannot deny, that whatſoever is Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, is Sacred, 'tis <hi>Juris Divini,</hi> of Divine Right, and therefore not to be altered by the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of Mankind. And to attempt a change in things of Divine Right, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes, either an imputation of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or elſe a diſtruſt of his Prudence and Providence, as if we were not content with what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath Ordained for us, but we muſt preſume to Reform his Ordinances, Detracting one thing, and Subſtituting another, to Reform, or Compleat the Work of the Omniſcient.</p>
               <p>A Sixth Objection; That the Order of Prieſthood was rightly and validly conferr'd in the Antient Church, as
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:101117:110"/>well by the <hi>Latines,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks,</hi> no Man doubts; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> retains all that was then in uſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears above, by the <hi>Rituals, Sect.</hi> 2. <hi>Ca.</hi> 3. and in particular, the Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands then uſed, with a Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory Forme, which is the Second Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Hands, contained in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ritual, with that Antient Prayer, to which, in the old Rituals is prefixt this Title, <hi>Conſecratio Presbyteri:</hi> the Conſecrating of a Prieſt, whereby Prieſthood was formerly conferr'd; wherefore the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Matter and Forme in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Ordination, wants none of the Eſſentials, and therefore her Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is valid. So <hi>Morinus, De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris Ordinationibus, Part.</hi> 3. <hi>Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi> 7. <hi>C.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. which he proves, by refelling the Opinions of other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who place the Eſſence of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in any of the other two Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Hands, or in the Tradition of the Inſtruments; which in theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent circumſtances, is no proofe at all, eſpecially to one, who impugnes them all. For this is no Argument; their Opinions are falſe; <hi>ergo</hi> mine is true. How eaſily is it Anſwered? that they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:101117:110"/>are all falſe, both his and theirs, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the contrary be proved. But he endeavors to prove his Opinion by the Autority of the Council of <hi>Trent, Seſs.</hi> 14. <hi>C.</hi> 3. where the Council Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Miniſters of Extreame Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be only Biſhops, <hi>aut Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes ab ipſis rite Ordinatos per Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem manuum Presbyterii: or elſe Prieſts by them Ordained by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Hands of the Presbytery:</hi> which refers to none but the Second Impoſition of Hands, according to the <hi>Roman Pontifical;</hi> for, in this alone, the Biſhop joyns his Right Hand with the other Prieſts upon the head of the Ordained.</p>
               <p>In this Opinion <hi>Morinus</hi> is ſingular, for I find no <hi>Author</hi> that holds it but himſelf, neither is it probable, that the Validity of Ordination in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt rely upon the Autority of one ſingle Author, who is a better <hi>Historian</hi> then <hi>Divine,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to all other <hi>Authors.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:101117:111"/>
               <p>Wherefore my Firſt Anſwer is, That this Impoſition of Hands, which <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> inſiſts upon, cannot validly confer the Order of Prieſthood, for want of an intention in the Miniſter to confer it hereby; For no Biſhop that Ordains can prudently intend to Ordain by this Impoſition of Hands only, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Church intend it: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe there is but one Author that holds it, all the Divines being wholly againſt it, aſſerting it to be only an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Ceremony, preparative to the collation of Order, but not at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Eſſence of it; For the greateſt part of Divines, and common perſwaſion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Impoſition of Hands at all, as belonging to the ſubſtance of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but place the whole Eſſence thereof in the Touching the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and their Forme. Others that allow to the Impoſition of Hands a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial concurrence, together with the Tradition of the Veſſels, yet none of them make choice of this Impoſition of Hands, but they all attribute this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial vertue to the Third Impoſition of Hands, after Communion, with this
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:101117:111"/>Forme, <hi>Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum remiſeritis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Receive the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, whoſe ſins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe, if the Church, or the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer, ſhould intend Ordination of Prieſts to be conferr'd by this Impoſition of Hands, and the Prayer that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nys it, as the total and compleat Eſſence, and ſubſtance thereof, they would thereby render the exhibiting of the Inſtruments and their Forme, wholly uſeleſs, which would reflect upon the Churches Prudence and Diſcretion, in introducing them; for no other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of this ſuperinduction, contrary to the conſtant practiſe of Antiquity, can be groundedly aſſign'd, but to be an adequate, or a partial cauſe of Prieſthood.</p>
               <p>My Second Anſwer is, That the Forme which accompanyeth the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Inſtruments, doth ſo plainly, ſo expreſly, and ſo explicite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſignifie, the Order of Prieſthood to be thereby conferr'd, that no Ordainer, that is in his right wits, can any way doubt of it, or call it in queſtion, but that the Church, by adding this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Forme, intended thereby to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:101117:112"/>confer to the Ordained the power of offering Sacrifice (wherein they place the Eſſence of Prieſthood) if then this power were given the Ordained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by that Second Impoſition of Hands, the Ordainer (if he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands what he ſays) muſt, <hi>volens, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens,</hi> confer that power over again, to the ſame Ordained; which is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; neither can the Church, who introduced it, avoid this inconvenience. For Reordination was, by a never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Tradition prohibited in the Church of God.

               <p>Hence it inſues, That though the <hi>Roman</hi> Ritual ſhould contain all the Eſſentials of Ordination, yet this would not evince the Validity of it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they reject that which is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, as a meer circumſtantial Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony inductive to Prieſthood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently have no intention to confer the Order by it. Which intention is a neceſſary condition, <hi>ſine qua non,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, no Order can be Validly conferr'd, as they all Teach, and is defined by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> as you may ſee above in the <hi>Fourth Section,</hi> and the Second Proofe. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:101117:113"/>Becauſe they have introduced a new Matter and Forme, never Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nor ever mentioned by the Apoſtles, nor the Primitive Church, by which they intend the Collation of Prieſthood; Wherefore ſhould the Prieſtly Power be conferr'd, by that Second Impoſition of Hands, then in every Ordination there would be a Sacrilegious attempt of Reordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A Seventh Objection: Though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> approves of the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Veſſels, with its proper Forme, yet it ſo allows it, as not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Impoſition of Hands, and therefore the Ordination is Valid, and no way repugnant to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for this additional Matter and Forme, is but a thing indifferent to the other parts of Ordination, and therefore cannot be prejudicial to them; for, as <hi>Gratian</hi> obſerves, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile per inutile non vitiatur; A uſeleſs addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot vitiate that which is uſeful.</hi> Wherefore,<note place="margin">Tridem. Seſs. <hi>21.</hi> C. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> according to the Council of <hi>Trent, Agnoſcens Sancta mater Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſia ſuam in Adminiſtratione Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum autoritatem. The Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Church, well knowing the power
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:101117:113"/>ſhe hath in the Administration of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhe may add, diminiſh, or alter, as incident occaſions and circumſtances ſhall require, ſtill retaining the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I Reply, That this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is already Anſwered, in the Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the precedent Objection. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this layes an Aſperſion upon the Church for introducing into the <hi>Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> a needleſs Addition, though in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it is deſtructive of the Validity of Ordination, by rendring the Eſſentials uſeleſs, and drawing from them the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Ordaining, as is above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared. But if this Addition be not Eſſential, Why is the power of offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifice expreſt in it? Surely the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> and Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Ninth, thought it Eſſential, as you may ſee above, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that which is added, is uſed as Eſſential, and that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, is rejected as Circumſtantial, which vitiates the Ordination.</p>
               <p>An Eighth Objection: The ground of this Diſcourſe, againſt the Validity of Ordination, according to the <hi>Roman</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:101117:114"/>Ritual, depends upon that Opinion, which allows to the Sacraments a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical influence, into the ſupernatural effects thereof; for, great difficulty is made, how Natural Cauſes can produce Supernatural Effects, on pretence, that none but an Omnipotent Power can elevate them, <hi>per potentiam obedientia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> to render Nature proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to that which is above Nature: wherefore admitting only a Moral Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, which is a probable opinion, held and maintained by many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, this difficulty will ceaſe, for then the Church may Ordain, and determine the Matters and Formes of Sacraments, without communicating to them, that Supernatural Power of producing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically and really ſuch like Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal effects, as are above Nature.</p>
               <p>My Firſt Anſwer is, That many Grave and Learned Divines, maintain, That the Sacraments do Really and Phyſically produce their Supernatural Effects; and they prove it by ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reaſons, wherefore this Opinion, both by Autority, and Reaſon, claimes the preference, eſpecially as being more conformable to the expreſſions of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:101117:114"/>Councils, who Teach, That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contain Grace, that is, virtually, which ſignifies a power to produce it, and alſo, that they confer Grace <hi>ex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re operato,</hi> &amp;c. that is, the Sacraments by their due application, confer Grace to the Receiver, through the power and vertue wherewith they are indued, by Divine Inſtitution, which is diſtinct from that Grace which is produced <hi>ex opere operantis,</hi> that correſponds to the piety and devotion of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. So the Council of <hi>Trent, Si quis dixerit per ipſa novae legis Sacramenta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Trid. Seſs. <hi>7.</hi> Can. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>ex opere operato, non conferri gratiam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anathema ſit. If any one ſhall ſay, that by the Sacraments of the New Law, there is not Grace conferr'd, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the vertue of the Sacrament, let him be Accurſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Second Anſwer is, That the Doctrine above delivered, depends not on either of theſe two Opinions deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately, for admit which you pleaſe, yet it cannot be deny'd, but that the Sacraments, duely applyed, bring with them an exigence, and infallible deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, for the conferring Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Graces, Imprinting the Character,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:101117:115"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by vertue of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution. Independant whereof, Pray what power is there in Nature to indue the Matter and Forme of Sacraments with ſuch vertue and exigence, which all the force of Nature can never pretend to, or challenge as due? So that an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power is here rigorouſly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to inſtitute and determine the Matter and Forme of Sacraments, (which is all their Eſſence) and to communicate to them this high Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, which ſurpaſſeth all the ſtrength of Nature, as well Angelical as Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
               <p>A Ninth Objection. In the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prieſthood, as well the Church as the Ordainer direct their intention to the whole Liturgy, thereby to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Order, not determining any one part more then another, and certainly the whole contains all the Eſſentials, and conſequently thereby the Order muſt be Validly conferr'd, there being nothing wanting, neither the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, nor the intention of the Miniſter to the Validity thereof.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:101117:115"/>
               <p>My Firſt Anſwer is, That though in ſome caſes a denomination may be appropriated to the whole, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applyed to the parts thereof, if taken ſeparately, as the compound of a body, and a reaſonable Soul, is a Man, and yet neither the Body nor the Soul, taken ſeparately, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is a Man. So likewiſe, a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is made up of ſeveral Unities, and yet never an Unity by it ſelf is a Number. Yet when there is a real and Phyſical effect to be produced, and the parts of the whole are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed ſucceſſively, ſo as that when one part is exiſtent, the other is paſt, and not then in being, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent parts are not yet extant. In this caſe a real effect cannot proceed from them all, neither by a Phyſical action, nor by a Phyſical determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but this real effect muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the ſame moment of time, when the cauſe of it is exiſtent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther its influence be Phyſical, or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, provided that its determination to ſuch an effect be Phyſical. Now for application.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:101117:116"/>
               <p>In the ſame moment of time that the Order of Prieſthood is conferr'd, there is a Spiritual Power given to the Ordained, there are ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Supernatural Graces produced, there is a Real Character Imprinted. Theſe are the effects. Now let us inquire into the Cauſe. The Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Matter and Forme of Ordination, duely applyed, are the cauſe of thoſe real effects, either by a real influence, and principiating the action which produceth them, or by a real deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, or ſtrict exigence of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then actually produced, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Divine Decree of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, ſo that the effect cannot be deferr'd, or ſuſpended, when the cauſe, either Phyſical or Moral is ſufficiently applyed. And certain it is, that the Ritual contains many circumſtantial, and accidental Rites, intermixt with the Eſſentials, and ſeveral parts of the Maſs, as they ſucceſſively occurre, for they are not all Eſſentials, neither is the Perſon to be Reordained if any one action of the whole Ritual be omitted. Whence it enſues, that ſome
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:101117:116"/>one determinate Matter and Forme in particular, is the cauſe of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned effects, and in that cauſe conſiſts the Eſſence of Ordination. And yet if we run over all the parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ritual, there is no Matter that can be Eſſential, except it be the Tradition of the Inſtruments, or the Impoſition of Hands; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe was ever eſteemed, in the leaſt, as Eſſential. The Tradition of the Veſſels cannot be Eſſential, as we have clearly proved above in the Fifth <hi>Section;</hi> as for the Impoſition of Hands, we find it in three places only in the <hi>Roman</hi> Ritual, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe three Impoſitions of Hands, belong to the Eſſential Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ordination, as we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Fourth <hi>Section,</hi> by Inducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or enumeration of parts.</p>
               <p>My Second Anſwer is, That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the drift of this Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is to involve all in obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and confuſion; yet, whether they will or no, their Eſſential Matter and Forme are fixt, from whence they cannot recede; for the Tradition of
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:101117:117"/>the Inſtruments, and the Forme that affects them, which they have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, can have no other end then to conſtitute the Eſſentials of Prieſthood. The Forme is this, <hi>Receive a power of offering Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words, if they have any ſignification, import a Power of offering Sacrifice then conferr'd upon the Ordained, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. And the offering of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is the chief action of a Prieſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it impowers him to Conſecrate the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which none but a Prieſt can do.<note place="margin">Albert. Mag. L. <hi>6.</hi> Theolog. veritatis. C. <hi>36.</hi>

                  <hi>Actus Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterorum</hi> (ſaith <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi>) <hi>eſt Conſecrare corpus, &amp; Sanguinem Christi; &amp; eſt actus principalis.

The other is conſequent, which is to Retain, and Abſolve: which they all grant, therefore they muſt acknowledge Prieſthood to be hereby conferr'd.</hi> For, To what other ſenſe can they draw thoſe words, <hi>Take, Receive, Accept the Power of offering Sacrifice?</hi> and the Ordained comes with a full intention to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Power; whence there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:101117:117"/>be the leaſt ſhadow of any other deſign, then intending this Matter and Forme, as the Eſſentials of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>

                  </note> but confounds them together: <hi>Si quis dixerit Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſive Sacram Ordinationem, non eſſe verè &amp; propriè Sacramentum à Chriſto Domino inſtitutum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Anathema ſit. If any one ſhall ſay, That Order, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordination, is not truly and properly a Sacrament, Inſtituted by</hi> Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c. let him be Accurſed.</hi> But I ſhall make it appear, that there is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difference between Order, and Ordination; the one is that which they call a Sacrament, the other not. The Order of Prieſthood is a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Power, whereby the Ordained is enabled, and Commiſſioned to exerciſe all Prieſtly Functions with Autority. The Ordination conſiſts in the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Matter and Forme regularly and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:101117:118"/>aptly applyed, by the Biſhop, which is the Ordainer, to him that is Ordained; and from this Matter and Forme ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, reſults in the Ordained, that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Power, which is properly the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Prieſthood, the Character is thereby Imprinted, and the Graces ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Prieſtly Miniſtry are alſo conferr'd. So that Order, with its concomitants, is the effect; but Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the cauſe. That is permanent in the Ordained for terme of life; this is tranſient, and paſſeth away, for it laſts no longer then while that power is in conferring. That is the principal end intended by <hi>Chriſt.</hi> This is the means Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to attain that end. That is, as it were a Patent, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which the Prieſt acts by, this the cauſe, either efficient or Moral, which procured it: wherefore theſe being ſo different from each other, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> could not intend to have them both Sacraments, but that alone (if any) muſt be a Sacrament, which confers the Order of Prieſthood to the Ordained, and alſo Imprints the Character, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all this is performed by Ordination, not by Order; for nothing can be the cauſe of it ſelf. Order is
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:101117:119"/>the effect, and therefore cannot be the cauſe. The Character and Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Graces are not produced by the Order, but by the Ordination, ſo that if any be a Sacrament it muſt be this, which being premiſed, as evident in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>A Tenth Objection, by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, is drawn from the precedent Doctrine: For if the Ordination of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be Invalid, it muſt of neceſſity draw with it, the Nullity of the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who received her Orders from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and cannot make out her Succeſſion of Biſhops from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> without paſſing through the ſides of the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, who muſt integrate the linkes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation; Wherefore, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have no true Biſhops, it ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably follows, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt lye under the ſame Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; for, one that hath no power of Order, can never confer that power upon another, becauſe none can give that which he hath not. Otherwiſe it would follow, that meerly Men, or Civil Magiſtrates, might confer Orders, which no Man will grant.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:101117:119"/>
               <p>My Anſwer to this Objection, is grounded in a Principle, received by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, namely, that where the true Eſſentials are regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and orderly applyed, though there be a defect in the Ordainer for want of the power of Order, yet if he Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, <hi>Cum titulo colorato, &amp; bona fide,</hi> the Ordination is valid.</p>
               <p>Four things therefore are neceſſary to the Validity of Ordination conferr'd by ſuch a Biſhop.</p>

                  <item>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That there be in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer <hi>Titulus coloratus, &amp; bona ſides;</hi> that is, a general preſumption, that he is a true Biſhop, and that he Ordains according to his Conſcience, knowing nothing amiſs.</item>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:101117:120"/>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he have a right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of conferring the Order.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Where theſe Requiſites do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre, the Ordination is certainly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Proof hereof is grounded upon that provident care that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ever had of his Church; for when all the Eſſentials and neceſſary Conditions are applyed, and no Moral defect to be imputed to the Ordainer, nor the Ordained, and no Humane prudence could ever detect that ſecret defect in the Ordainer; it would be too ſevere that the Original Inſtituter of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould refuſe to the Ordained the power of Order, nay, in a ſhort time, it would prove deſtructive to the whole Church; for <hi>Christ</hi> knew full well, the fragility of Humane Nature, and conſidering his infinite Wiſdom, and Protection of his Church, would not oblige our imbecility to Moral Impoſſibilities; or if we failed by our Natural Weakneſs, without either ſin, or voluntary error, would permit the utter ruine and deſtruction of his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:101117:120"/>Church; which would certainly inſue, if ſuch Ordinations were not valid. For I ſuppoſe the Ordainers and Ordained, to proceed with a candid, ſincere, and good Conſcience, and that Morally ſpeaking, have not the leaſt ſuſpicion of any default or want of power in the Ordainer; nay, he himſelf neither knows, nor ſurmiſeth any deſiciency in his Order. In this Caſe, Should the Ordination be void, and null? Whom could we impute it to? certainly to none but thoſe, who by their Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inductions pretended to Correct <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitutions, and thereby rendred all defective. But muſt this be ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as to involve all Poſterity into the Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame Crime, who were no way conſenting to it? nay, who in due time reformed ſuch abuſes, and wholly diſclaimed from them? No certainly, our Great Redeemer is more equitable, and knows who rejects his Ordinances, and Inſtitutions, and who endeavors to maintain them.</p>
               <p>But now, ſince Pride, Ambition, or a vain Pretence to an Arbitrary Power, againſt Divine Right, or what Motive
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:101117:121"/>elſe, I know not, induced the Prelates of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to evacuate <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitutions, and in their place to ſubſtitute their own, and hereby to make Ordination void; ſo likewiſe is Human frailty ſubject to many ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, whereof ſome are imputable of crime to the firſt Authors, but not to thoſe that ſucceed them, for I ſuppoſe theſe to be blinded by invincible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; others proceed only from the weakneſs, and limited capacity of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, without any deformity or Moral defect in their wills. Wherefore ſhould the Church of God ſo rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our weak capacities, that a ſecret and clandeſtine defect in an Ordainer, which no vigilance, nor Human pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution can avoid (when all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites are applyed, and all have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ignorance of that ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?) Should this, I ſay, render all his Ordinations invalid, when all other requiſites are applyed? then another ſuch defect, may, on the ſame account, incidently fall on another, conſidering our weakneſs, or Malice in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and ſo on a third, and at length no Biſhop, nor Prieſt, that's validly Ordained, will be found in the Church.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:101117:121"/>See how this is inductive to the Churches ruine, which certainly had been long-ſince deſtroyed, had not the Divine Inſtituter thereof maintained it by ſupplying ſuch defects (which we can neither avoid nor prevent) which he can as eaſily do, as he firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Sacraments, and Ordination; for it is he alone that gives the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Order to the Ordained, and to give it in theſe circumſtances is but congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for none concerned in ſuch an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination are blameworthy, and not to give it, is abſolutely, and (by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon providence) inevitably deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the whole Church, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Supreme Lord thereof, will not deliver up to ruine, ſince with ſo much difficulty, care, and tenderneſs, he Inſtituted it, and to the ſame it belongs firſt to Inſtitute, and then to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>But, this Doctrine ſeems to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the occaſion of a reply; for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that <hi>Titulus coloratus, &amp; bona fides,</hi> do ſupply the defect of Order in the Ordainer; ſo that one who is by all eſteemed, and reputed a true Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, yet in effect, by reaſon of ſome
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:101117:122"/>ſecret default, is not ſo, when all other requiſites, and eſſentials, are aptly and duely applyed, do validly Ordain: Why then cannot this Doctrine be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops? For if they ſhould be defective in the Power of Order, yet adhibiting all eſſentials, and other neceſſary conditions, their Ordinations would alſo be valid among themſelves; for we cannot in Charity preſume, that they proceed againſt their Conſcience, or that they want that ſincerity, and right intention which we ſuppoſe in others. This being ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the caſe is the ſame; for if the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops validly Ordained the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Why ſhould not they validly Ordain their own?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That they Ordain their own Prieſts and Biſhops according to the <hi>Roman</hi> Ritual, and conſequently they want the maine requiſite, which is the eſſential Matter and Forme, for they have Innovated a Matter and Forme of their own, far different from that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> Inſtituted, and they cleerly ſignifie by that Forme, that they intend thereby to confer the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:101117:122"/>Order of Prieſthood, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not intend to Ordain by the Eſſential Matter and Forme derived from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles (if any ſuch be contained in their Ritual) except they would be reputed deluders, as hath been proved at large in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh <hi>Sections</hi> of this <hi>Diſputation.</hi> Wherefore according to the diſpoſition of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Ritual, the Eſſence of Ordination cannot ſubſiſt. And certainly nothing can have a being, without its own Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, as all muſt grant. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> partly by adding their new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Eſſentials, to which their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ordaining muſt be fixed, and partly by Inverting the Order, have made ſo great a confuſion, that one part deſtroys another, and particularly their Eſſentials, do abſolutely deſtroy the Eſſentials Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> (if their Liturgy contain any ſuch) and hinder their effect.</p>
               <p>But when the Biſhops, that were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted their Communion, and Ordained the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they did it by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ritual, which contains the very Eſſential Matter and Forme Inſtituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and delivered
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:101117:123"/>to us by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which were ſo due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and regularly applyed to the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as was ever in practiſe in the antient Church, ſo that here nothing at all was wanting, that in the caſe propoſed, was neceſſary to the validity of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Wherefore this Ordination is far different from that which the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Biſhops uſe, when they Ordain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Roman</hi> Paſtoral. And conſequently, the Ordination which the <hi>Romans</hi> uſe among themſelves is Invalid, but the Ordination of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Biſhops reteins its Integrity.</p>
               <p>A Second Proofe hereof is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the practiſe of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, whoſe Ordination the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever approved as valid, yet they always uſed the Impoſition of hands, as the Eſſential matter of Prieſthood, with this Forme, <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Gratia, quae ſemper infirma ſanat, &amp; deficientia complet, promovet hunc Deo amabilem Diaconum in Presbyterum. The Divine Grace that always cures that which is infirme, and compleats that which is deficient, promotes this pious Deacon to Prieſthood.</hi> Conſider here what precaution the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſed in the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:101117:123"/>Forme of their Ordination; for knowing, how prone we are all to errors, and miſtakes; they, in a matter of ſuch high concern, have recourſe to the Author of Grace, to confirm, and ſtrengthen that, which, by Human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, might be weak and unſtable; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to compleat the defects, and ſupply the wants of their Ordination, in caſe any thing elſe ſhould be neceſſary, not known to them; And hereby they uſed their beſt endeavors, to prevent the nullity of their Ordinations, which might proceed from their own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or inadvertency, as not being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, how many errors, and miſtakes we are ſubject to, notwithſtanding the beſt of our endeavors to the contrary. Which implyes a confidence in them, that uſing the true Eſſentials, and a right intention, <hi>Chriſt</hi> would ſupply all other ſecret defects; whereof the want of the power of Order in the Ordainer is one, eſpecially, when he is generally reputed by all, and by himſelf alſo, a true Biſhop. For as it is above ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, in the beginning of this <hi>Section,</hi> the Power of Order in the Ordained, is no Eſſential part of Ordination, but meerly the effect thereof, ſo that the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:101117:124"/>Ordination is Eſſentially, and Specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally compleat without it; and becauſe Ordination is Inſtituted by <hi>Christ,</hi> as a means to determine him to confer this Spiritual Power upon the Ordained, How reaſonable and congruous is it, that the cauſe being compleat, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſhould not be wanting? eſpecially ſince it exceeds our capacity to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the defect. For when a cauſe is hinder'd from producing his effect, either by contrary agents, or by the indiſpoſition of the <hi>Medium,</hi> or by the incapacity of the <hi>Paſſum,</hi> we cannot thence infer, that the agent is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, or wants vertue, <hi>quantum eſt ex ſe,</hi> for as much as belongs to it, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce its effect. But in this caſe, the power of Order, is no Phyſical, but a <hi>Moral</hi> effect; and in all Ordinations it is given by <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone, <hi>ad exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam Ordinationis,</hi> by a determination, which proceeds from the Ordination, by vertue of Divine Inſtitution; for it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone that impowers the Ordained, validly to exerciſe the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Order, which is but a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power, whoſe immediate cauſe is not the Ordainer, but only <hi>Chriſt,</hi> thereunto determin'd by the Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:101117:124"/>which doth very much facilitate and confirm the foreſaid Doctrine.</p>
               <p>A Third Proofe, is drawn from an acknowledged Principle of thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> who, after a vacancy, when a new Pope is choſen, the Cardinals in the Conclave only concur to make the Election Canonical, which being done, all the Power they have, cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate to the new elected Pope, that Univerſal Juriſdiction over all the Church, which they pretend to, becauſe they have no ſuch Jurisdiction in themſelves, every Biſhop and Cardinal being confined within the limits of his own Dioceſs: and one Biſhop cannot extend his Juriſdiction to the Subjects of another Dioceſs. From whence then doth the Pope receive his pretended Univerſal Juriſdiction? Here they muſt of neceſſity have recourſe to the Supreame Lord of the Church, which is <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, for the obtaining this Juriſdiction for their new Pope, which neither they, nor their Canonical Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can effect; for this Election is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Condition, not the Cauſe of ſuch an illimited Juriſdiction, ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone is the only cauſe of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:101117:125"/>Papal Juriſdiction. Why then in like caſe, when the Ordination is compleated <hi>in foro externo,</hi> and no error committed <hi>in foro interno?</hi> Why I ſay, in this caſe, ſhould not <hi>Chriſt</hi> in like manner confer to the Ordained the Spiritual Power of Order? for though the Ordination be never ſo Canonical and compleat, yet ſtill it is <hi>Chriſt</hi> alone that grants the power of Order, and it is he alone that gives Juriſdiction to every Biſhop in his Ordination; and even in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of Biſhops comes not from the Pope, but from <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Juriſdictio Epiſcopalis eſt Juris Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vini; Epiſcopal Juriſdiction is of Divine Right, becauſe it proceeds immediately from Christ.</hi> So that in any Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when no eſſential nor neceſſary condition is wanting, though the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainer have not the power of Order, yet being univerſally reputed a true Biſhop, and this defect being ſecret, that Morally ſpeaking, no Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry can diſcover it, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencerned in the Ordination do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed ſincerely, and with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; What true Chriſtian can frame ſo hard a judgment of our Great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:101117:125"/>as to deny to the Ordained the power of Order, and thereby per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſo great a breach in his Church, which hath an immediate tendency to the utter ruine thereof, when it may be ſo eaſily remedied, and when neither the Ordainer, nor the Ordained, can, in the leaſt, have any imputation of blame?</p>
               <p>As to the Point of Succeſſion men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Objection; I Anſwer, That this ſucceſſion is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in a Mathematical but a Moral Senſe, and it is the ſame in Ordination, as it is in all other Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical points, and Principles of Faith, contained under the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. For though the <hi>Latin</hi> Church (which is but one Branch of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Church) was Guilty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Errors in matter of Faith, and for many years ſwerv'd from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practiſe of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> yet this could impoſe no neceſſity upon the Succeſſors of this Branch, ever to be excluded from the hopes of Salvation. For when the <hi>Erroneous Principles</hi> of the Church of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:101117:126"/>
                  <hi>Rome</hi> were ſufficiently detected, they might, yea they ought, to Reforme ſuch abuſes, and to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Original Doctrine, and Practiſe of the Primitive Church, which were the immediate Succeſſors to the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and ſo to redintegrate their Faith, and for the future, to regulate their Faith and Practiſe, by that never erring Rule of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> And ſhall then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Object againſt them, that they cannot prove their Succeſſion from <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> Which in plain termes ſignifies no more then this, That they have not perſiſted in the Errors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but have imbraced a new Doctrine. New indeed to them, but exactly conformable to the old Doctrine, which <hi>Christ</hi> left to his Church, and which the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> long ſince deſerted, and ſo Interrupted the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of Profeſſing the True and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Principles of <hi>Christ,</hi> which we, by our Reformation, do Reaſſume, and chuſe rather to follow <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,</hi> then to adhere to the Falſe and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:101117:126"/>Erroneous Principles of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> If this be a Crime, then we are Guilty. Muſt we lye under the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Blame, becauſe we would not run headlong, to utter Ruine and Damnation, by adhering to the Erroneous Doctrine of <hi>Rome?</hi> Muſt that one word of <hi>Succeſſion</hi> ſtartle us, and be inductive to perſwade us, to leave Heaven, and go with them to Hell for Company's ſake? They have made a long continued Breach in the Church themſelves, and interrupted their own Succeſſion, and, Muſt they blame us for returning to the Truth, becauſe we will not ſucceed them in their Errors? So then our Succeſſion in Dogmatical Points, in Practiſe and Ordination, conſiſts in this, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Breach made by the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, we having cleerly Detected the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, have reunited our ſelves again, to the Antient and True Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and deteſted the oppoſite and Erroneous Doctrine of thoſe that had Apoſtated from the True Church.</p>
               <p>The laſt Clauſe contained in the cloſe of the Objection, that purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:101117:127"/>to this Doctrine, a meer Secular Layman may confer Orders, is eaſily ſolved, becauſe this no way follows; for in this caſe, he could neither Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain with a colourable Title, nor with a good Conſcience, which are both neceſſary for the validity of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; he wants the firſt, becauſe he never was eſteemed to have the power of Order, and he himſelf knows certainly that he never was in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor ever attempted to receive them; ſo that in preſuming to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, he commits a heinous Sacrilege, by a groſs contempt of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which is inconſiſtent with a candid, ſincere, and conſcientious proceeding, ſo that he wants the ſecond alſo, and beſides, in ſo doing, he can never have a right intention to confer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, becauſe he is conſcious, that he cannot have ſeveral requiſites, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he cannot Ordain.</p>
               <p>I only add this General Rule; That according to the preſent Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Inſtitution of <hi>Christ,</hi> practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Primitive Church, it is impoſſible to confer Prieſthood va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:101117:127"/>except the Impoſition of Hands be applyed as the Eſſential Matter, and accompanyed by the words of the Biſhop, ſignifying Prieſthood to be thereby conferr'd, as the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Forme, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> Religiouſly obſerveth in their Ordination; for while the Biſhop with other Prieſts, puts his Hands upon the Head of him that is to be Ordained, he pronounceth this Forme;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Receive the Holy Ghost, for the Office and Work of a Prieſt, in the Church of God, now committed unto thee, by the Impoſition of our Hands. Whoſe ſins thou doſt forgive, they are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whoſe ſins thou doſt retain, they are retained. Aud be thou a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſpenſer of the Word of God, and of his Holy Sacraments, in the Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here are both the Eſſentials duely applyed, and punctually obſerved. Whereas the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:101117:128"/>neither as an Eſſential part, and therefore their Ordination of Prieſts, according to their own Doctrine, can in no way be Valid.</p>

               <p>HOw many falſe Aſpertions, and querulous Cavillations, have been raiſed by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> againſt the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under that frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous pretence of their being Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the <hi>Naggs head</hi> Tavern, in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> by one ſingle Biſhop, or at moſt by two, and they not Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Elected, and Conſecrated, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. All which were falſe and Malitious Calumnies, invented for no other end, then to depreſs the Autority of the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> thereby to facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their acceſs, to draw Proſelites from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to their Communion. Which ſcandalous, and ungrounded Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been fully Anſwered, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:101117:129"/>the Canonical Ordination, and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration of the Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> cleerly vindicated from the falſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of all ſuch Detracters, by that Worthy, and Learned Prelate <hi>John Bramhall, D.

               </p>
               <p>But, What judgment ſhall we frame, of the Ordination of Biſhops, and Prieſts in the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> there being at preſent neither <hi>Pope,</hi> nor <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,</hi> nor <hi>Biſhop,</hi> nor <hi>Prieſt,</hi> but ſuch as have been Ordained according to their new Model of Ordination; we ſhall not need here to have recourſe to frivolous, and feigned Stories, where ſuch grounded Truths ſtrike at the very Eſſentials of their Ordination, and evince the invalidity thereof. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they raiſe a Battery of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt us, without deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves; for the Proofes of the nullity of their Ordination, are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their own Doctrine. They all Teach, That Ordination is a Sacrament Inſtituted by <hi>Christ.</hi> The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath defined it ſo to be, as we ſee above, <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. They all aſſert the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Forme of all Sacraments, to

                  <hi>Si mutatio materiae aut formae Eſſentialis, ſeu ſubstantialis ſit, nullum eſſicitur Sacramentum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Suarez,</hi> which is the current opinion of their other Divines. It is likewiſe certain, that the matter which they uſe in the Collation of Prieſthood is eſſentially, and more then Specifically different, from the matter which <hi>Christ</hi> Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which was conſtantly uſed in Ordinations many Centuries after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> before Ordination was new molded. It is alſo certain, that the Forme of Ordination determined by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and a long time in uſe in the Church, is now utterly rejected, and caſt out.</p>
               <p>All this being duely ponder'd, we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that their Ordination is invalid, except ſome other grounded expedient can be found out, and proved, to uphold the validity of their Ordination, which hitherto I cannot diſcover, but wiſh I
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:101117:130"/>could. But no quibbles, nor quirkes, nor nice diſtinctions, can any way avail them; for the matter of Fact is uncontrolea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Doctrinal part is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by their own Words, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which it is now too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. It is time therefore for them, ſeriouſly to conſider what expedient may be found out, to reinvalidate their Ordination, and to qualifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo, as they may be in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to prevent this grand inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the future; for this ſhakes the very foundation, and renders the whole Hierarchy of their Church rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous. If there are no Prieſts, there can be no Biſhops, ſince Epiſcopacy is no new Order ſuperadded, but only a farther extenſion of the Order and Character of Prieſthood, as they teach; well then may the Biſhops exerciſe their <hi>potestatem jurisdictionis,</hi> but can no way exerciſe, nor communicate to others their <hi>poteſtatem Ordinis,</hi> for none can exerciſe nor confer upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a power which he neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, nor virtually, nor radically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in himſelf <hi>jure communi;</hi> but their Juriſdiction they diſtinguiſh from the Order of Presbitery, ſince divers Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:101117:130"/>and Cardinals in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are only Deacons, or Subdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, and yet their Juriſdiction is as ample, and hath as great an extenſion, as if they were Prieſts, who common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make uſe of other Suffraganean Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, to Officiate, Confirm, and confer Orders in their Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>Hence it enſues, that thoſe puta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhops, which are preſumed to be Canonically indued with Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery and Epiſcopacy (yet in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are not ſo) when they perſonally exerciſe the Functions of Epiſcopacy, their Confirmation is void, yea, their very Conſecration of Chriſme, and other Holy Oyles, is of no effect: but after Conſecration, they retain nothing but the Natural Elements of Oyle and Balſome, as they were before, and ſo are uncapable of rendring any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Emolument, to thoſe to whom they are applyed; their Impoſition of Hands, and Benedictions, are no way available to the Confirmed, no more than if they were performed by a Lay-perſon; for where the radical power of Order is wanting, none of theſe Spiritual and Supernatural effects can enſue.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:101117:131"/>
               <p>And when they Officiate in Maſs, and attempt to Conſecrate the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and having Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Hoaſte, they kneel down to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it, and then elevate it, and ſhew it to the People, that they alſo may adore it; both they themſelves, and many Thouſands of the People do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commit, at leaſt a Material Idolatry, though it may be, that Invincible Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance may excuſe them from a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal one: for they exhibit a worſhip of <hi>Latria</hi> to a ſuppoſed Deity, under the ſpecies of Bread, when, in reality, no ſuch Deity is there, ſo as they give to the meer ſubſtance of Bread, a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip due to God alone. And this is daily repeated thorough the whole ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction. And the ſame happens, when any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Prieſt Officiates; for the Order of Prieſthood is equally defective in them all: and where there is no power of Order, to qualifie them for Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, this muſt of neceſſity be void.</p>
               <p>So when they adminiſter the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to the People, who preſent themſelves, in hopes to receive the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thoſe Graces, which from
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:101117:131"/>thence accrew to the worthy Receivers; Poor Souls! How are they deluded, and their hopes fruſtrated? for, whereas they came full fraught withthe expectation of Spiritual and Supernatural Graces, they are diſmiſt with a bare piece of Bread, and not the leaſt acceſs made to their inherent and ſanctifying, nor to their actual and tranſient Graces. Neither is it for once or twice, that they are ſo treated, but conſtantly, and <hi>toties quoties,</hi> which certainly is an unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy abuſe, and a Spiritual Cheat, did not the Authors thereof proceed <hi>bonâ fide,</hi> as not hgving detected the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>Their Power of Relaxing and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſins, participates much of the nature of Epiſcopacy, in this reſpect, that neither the one nor the other is a diſtinct Order from Prieſthood, but both of them neceſſarily and eſſentially preſuppoſe Prieſthood already Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd, as the ground-work and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which they depend; ſo that the Power of Abſolving, is a ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to Prieſthood, or rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent faculty that iſſues from it; and if this Order be wanting, that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:101117:132"/>power can never be validly conferr'd; wherefore the Penitents preſuming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the validity of this Power, and their eaſie acceſs to Abſolution, hence take occaſion to be leſs circumſpect, and to let the reins looſe to ſuch ſins as their ſenſual appetite prompts them to; but when they come to make their Confeſſion, and receive Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though they have diſcover'd their Sore, and the nature of the Spiritual Diſtemper of their Souls, yet no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Medicine can be apply'd, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Cure, for want of Ability in their Spiritual Phyſitian; for where the Radical Power is wanting, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Effect cannot be produced: ſo they return with the clogg of their ſins, as burthenſome to them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came.</p>
               <p>And not to inſiſt upon any more particulars, I ſhall conclude with this General Maxime; that the Invalidity of all other Functions, peculiar to Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood alone, is an inſeparable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Invalidity of their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:101117:132"/>
               <p>But it may be pretended, that <hi>Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, Communion, Abſolution,</hi> &amp;c. may be validly performed by one that hath <hi>titulum coloratum, &amp; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam fidem,</hi> a colourable title, a good Conſcience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though he ſhould want the power of Order; according to the rule above given, in the <hi>Eighth Section.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That it is not likely, nor probable, that the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Word, would imploy his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, to grant ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary favors to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe he can have no valuable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to do it. For, Why ſhould <hi>Chriſt</hi> beſtow ſuch ſingular Graces on his Enemies? who have deſerted his Doctrine, changed his Ordinances and Inſtitutions, rob'd him (as much as in them lyeth) of his Prerogatives, and uſurp'd to themſelves a Power, which is peculiar to himſelf alone; and theſe favors to be conſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon them, and to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without intermiſſion, till the World's end, for there is little hope
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:101117:133"/>of their Retractation. And I dare aver, that if any indifferent judgment, ſhould ſeriouſly ponder their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Errors, whereof ſome are propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and proved in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> (which I am ready to maintain againſt any legal oppoſition) it would plainly appear, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is but a corrupted branch of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſequeſter'd from the True Church. And though I cannot deny, but that our benign Lord, grants to all (out of the Treaſure of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits) Grace ſufficient for their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; yet, I fear, they will ſcarce render this Grace efficacious, by their cooperation with it; for it muſt be an extraordinary, a potent Grace, that muſt incline them to a Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, that this Caſe propoſed in the Objection, is far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, from the Rule given above in the <hi>Eighth Section;</hi> for there the Queſtion was, of the preſervation, or utter ruine of a True Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which cannot ſubſiſt without
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:101117:133"/>true Ordination; but here the caſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns particular perſons, and they likewiſe, by the pravity of their own wills, long ſince, cut off from the True Church of <hi>Christ;</hi> neither would theſe favors (if granted) revive their Church, ſo as to render its Doctrine Orthodox, or any way to reduce the Members, or Heads thereof to a better ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in this Caſe, there is no ground, nor motive to induce <hi>Chriſt</hi> to grant ſuch an extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſe; but in the former caſe it was ſtrictly neceſſary for the preſervation of a conſiderable part of the True Church of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, in the Caſe here propoſed, our Omnipotent Redeemer muſt have recourſe to his Illimited Power, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make ſo many Thouſands of Miracles, and this conſtantly to be continued without interruption; but in the former caſe, we only Aſſert, that upon juſt and congruous grounds, our Gratious Redeemer, only for once, ſupplyed the defect of Order,

               <p>THe Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Sancta mater Eccleſia,</hi> pretends to ſo much Power and Autority, in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſpoſing of all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Sacraments, that it not only preſcribes the Manner and Method of their Adminiſtration, but alſo pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates into the very Eſſence, and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of them, Subtracting, Adding, and Changing what ſhe pleaſeth; and indeed, in five of them, there might be ſome ſeeming pretence for it, they having received the honor of being called Sacraments, from that Churches Inſtitution, without ſufficient ground in Scripture for it; whereof this of Matrimony is one; of which we ſhall here Treate.</p>
               <p>Marriage is a Contract between Man and Woman, containing a Mutual Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to each other, by proper words, <hi>de preſenti;</hi> the laſt words <hi>de preſenti,</hi>

The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> hath defin'd Matrimony to be a Sacrament, and Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd thoſe that ſhall deny it. <hi>Si quis dixerit Matrimonium,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By the Conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there are ſeveral Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Marriage, which are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht into two Claſſis. The Firſt are ſuch as render Matrimony Invalid, which they call <hi>impedimenta dirimentia;</hi> They of the Second Claſſis are only <hi>impedientia,</hi> which render the perſons <hi>inhabiles,</hi> to Contract lawfully, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Contracted, the Marriage is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid. To Contract clandeſtinely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Witneſſes as can give ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent proofe and evidence of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, <hi>in foro externo,</hi> hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prohibited, and therefore held unlawful, but yet valid; though now, ſince the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:101117:135"/>invalid. The words of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil are theſe,<note place="margin">Trid Seſs. <hi>24.</hi> C. <hi>1.</hi> Reforan. Matrim.</note> 
                  <hi>Qui aliter quam praeſenti Parocho vel alio Sacerdote de ipſius Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochi, ſeu Ordinarii licentia, &amp; duobus, vel tribus testibus, Matrimonium contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here attentabunt; eos Sancta Synodus ad ſic contrahendum omnino inhabiles red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit; &amp; hujuſmodi contractus irritos &amp; nullos eſſe decernit; prout eos praeſenti decreto irritos facit &amp; annullat.</hi> By which Decree, Clandeſtine Marriage which was before valid, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, is now made void, and of no effect.</p>
               <p>Were Matrimony only a Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and not defin'd by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to be elevated to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Sacrament, and to produce Grace, here would be little ground of altercation; for it is not my intent, in this Diſcourſe, to call in queſtion the power of Eccleſiaſtical, or Secular Law-givers, in matters of this nature. But they acknowledge Marriage to be a Sacrament; and the Matter and Forme thereof (wherein conſiſts the whole Eſſence of it) to be inſtituted, and determin'd by Divine Autority, whence it becomes <hi>Juris Divini.</hi> Hence ariſeth the difficulty, How the Church
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:101117:136"/>of <hi>Rome</hi> can make any alteration or change; or how they can declare, that to be ineffectual, and void, which <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is determinately ſetled, and eſtabliſht as valid.</p>
               <p>Clandeſtine Marriage, before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> was ever held an Eſſential and a valid Matrimony, though unlawful, <hi>factum valet, ſed fieri non licet:</hi> yea, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Councils Decree, they ſtill hold it valid in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> where the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was never received, nor promulged; for they Teach, That no Human Law can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Obligation to the obſervance of it, but in ſuch places where it hath been ſufficiently intimated, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Here I ſuppoſe with them, that the whole Eſſence and Subſtance of each Sacrament, conſiſts purely in the two Eſſential parts, the Matter, and the Forme. The Matter of this Contract is the Internal Conſent of the Perſons Contracting, expreſt by ſome External and ſenſible ſign: The Forme is the words, <hi>de praeſenti; I take thee,</hi> &amp;c. which ſignifie a Mutual Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of themſelves to each other, for term of life. Hence I Argue againſt
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:101117:136"/>them, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> ſuppoſing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution as the Origine and Cauſe of all Sacraments.</p>
               <p>The whole Eſſence of Matrimony neceſſarily Conſtitutes a valid Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; but the Matter and Forme are the whole Eſſence of Matrimony; <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the Matter and Forme neceſſarily conſtitute a valid Marriage. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor is univerſally true in all things; for the whole Eſſence of a thing, and the thing it ſelf are convertible: the Minor is their own Dectrine, as appears by their own words above ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Whence I ſubſume, The Matter and Forme neceſſarily conſtitute a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Marriage; but Clandeſtine Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony contains the Matter and Forme, <hi>ergo,</hi> Clandeſtine Matrimony contains a valid Marriage. The Major is the concluſion of the laſt ſillogiſme. The Minor I prove <hi>Firſt;</hi> becauſe Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Matrimony was valid before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and yet it contains now the ſame Matter and Forme it did then. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I prove it, becauſe Clandeſtine Marriage is ſtill valid where the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was never received, <hi>ergo,</hi> it hath the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:101117:137"/>and Forme of Marriage, which was Inſtituted, and determin'd by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as the whole Eſſence of it: for they that Contract <hi>Clandestinè,</hi> have the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal conſent made ſenſible, which is the Matter; and uſe the ſame words by way of Forme, as they that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract <hi>in facie Eccleſiae;</hi> wherefore if the one hath the ſame Matter and Forme with the other (wherein conſiſts the whole Eſſence of Marriage) if the one be valid, the other muſt be valid alſo.</p>
               <p>And this Argument proceeds in like manner againſt all other <hi>impedimenta dirimentia,</hi> ſuch impediments, as <hi>Jure Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> are introduced to render Matrimony void, and of no effect: but if there be any impediment <hi>jure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae,</hi> deſtructive of the validity of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, In this caſe it is moſt like, that the Original Inſtituter excepted it. As many of the <hi>Roman</hi> Divines conceive Conſanguinity in the Firſt Degree, to invalidate Matrimony, <hi>jure naturae,</hi> by reaſon of the horror and averſion that Nature hath againſt a Fathers Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own Daughter, or a Mothers taking her own Son for a Husband, or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:101117:137"/>for a Brother to Marry his own Siſter. And therefore Marriage, in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Conſanguinity, was ever held invalid, in the Evangelical Law.</p>
               <p>But this adminiſters matter for an inſtance againſt what hath been ſaid: for Marriage contracted in the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, hath all the Eſſentials of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and only the proximity of Blood hinders the validity of it, therefore it is not enough to have all the Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, as Matter and Forme, to make Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony valid. I Anſwer, that all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments do neceſſarily ſuppoſe the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Inſtitution, upon which they Eſſentially depend; for the Eſſential parts of all Sacraments are in themſelves natural things, but by the Omnipotent Power of the Divine Inſtituter, the Complex which reſults of theſe parts is elevated <hi>per potentiam obedientialem,</hi> to produce Grace in the Receiver; in that quality and degree, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſetled and eſtabliſht, without which they are no Sacraments. And who can deny but that it was in the free power and election of the Divine Inſtituter, to affix his Supernatural Graces, where,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:101117:138"/>and when, and to what Inſtruments he pleaſed, for Sacraments are, by Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but inſtruments to convey the Graces Merited by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to our Souls; wherefore, it being incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that a Contract made in the firſt degree of Conſanguinity, from which Nature hath ſo great a horror, ſhould be an inſtrument of conveying Grace to the Souls of the contracters; ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Reaſon dictates, that this was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and never Inſtituted for a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which the conſtant practice of the Church from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s time ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently confirms.</p>
               <p>But it may bereply'd, That if <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the Original Inſtitution, Ordained, that all complexes reſulting from ſuch a determinate Matter and Forme, ſhould be Sacraments, and yet an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception may be made in one caſe, Why not in another? I Anſwer, That this Reply is grounded on a falſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, for it ſuppoſeth <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have confuſed acts, ſuch as are proper to Men, when they determine things in general, and make an univerſal with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinguiſhing, or diſtinctly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:101117:138"/>the particulars contained under that univerſal, which argues the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection of Human underſtanding, and therefore ſuch obſcure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect acts have no place in <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for the underſtanding of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word is infinite, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exempt from the leaſt imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>And the underſtanding of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Humanity was indued with an infuſed knowledge, whereby he ſaw, and knew clearly, and diſtinctly, all that concerned, at leaſt himſelf, as Redeemer of Mankind: ſo that when he Inſtituted the Sacraments, he did it not by a general notion, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon every particular indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, cleerly, and diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, in the Caſe propoſed, he Ordained ſuch, and ſuch particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Contracts to be inſtruments of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Grace, and no others; ſo as thoſe only which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath ſo deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, are valid Contracts, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution, and no others; and, by
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:101117:139"/>this means, the cleerneſs and perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s underſtanding, hath partioularly determin'd every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Contract of Marriage, that ever hath been, or ever will be, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed its validity, or non validity in his Original Inſtitution, ſo as all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and Decrees, as are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Human, have no power at all to alter, or change any thing, or to make this valid, and that invalid: theſe things being already immutably determin'd by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Inſtitution, which conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is <hi>Juris Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note, that though there be no warrant in Holy Writ, to conclude Matrimony a Sacrament; yet, becauſe I Diſpute <hi>ad hominem,</hi> I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuppoſed it to be a Sacrament, and ſhall ſo do for the future, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to detect their Error, and the inconſequence of their Principles, for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> will needs have it a Sacrament, producing Grace, and hath defin'd it ſo to be; and <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentandi

                  <hi>SECT. XI.</hi> The Arguments to vindicate the Nullity of <hi>Clandeſtine Marriage,</hi> Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</head>
               <p>THe Firſt, and Principal Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, That though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends no Right, directly to alter or change any thing appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet it may have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct power, by ſubtracting the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of that contract which is the groundwork and foundation of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution; for none but a civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was elevated by <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; ſo that the validity of the contract, and the mutual obligation which it induced, was preſuppoſed to Divine Inſtitution; and ſuch a contract <hi>Chriſt</hi> elevated to the dignity of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and enabled it to produce Grace. Wherefore the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> having ample power to declare that, and other ſuch contracts, to be valid, or invalid, The Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:101117:140"/>in perſuance to this power, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Clandeſtine Marriage to be no Civil Contract, by taking away the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obligation, and conſequently the validity of it. And in all this the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil never toucheth the Ordination of the Primitive Inſtituter, but preciſely alters the contract, which is only, <hi>Juris Humani,</hi> and therefore intrencheth not in the leaſt upon Divine Inſtitution. This is the full ſtrength of this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Anſwer, This is a ſubtil and a plauſible ſpeculation, to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their treſpaſſing upon Divine Right, by pretending nothing but an indirect Power, whereby they wholly evacuate <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, as much as if they had a direct power to do it. 'Tis not unlike the indirect power which his Holineſs pretends to have, over the Territories and Dominions of Kings, and Secular Princes. For it cannot be deny'd (as they pretend) but that he hath a direct power to exerciſe his Juriſdiction, to ſuppreſs he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and propagate his Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt neceſſarily have a power, to uſe ſuch means as are requiſite to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:101117:141"/>this end, and to remove all obſtacles; that may impede the attaining of it. Now ſuppoſe that a King, or Secular Prince, connives at Hereticks, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits Hereſie within his Dominions; the Legate firſt admoniſheth him of the danger of it, but in vain; then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes his Maſter, the Pope, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a gentle Brief comes to the Prince, from his Holineſs, minding him of his duty, and endeavoring to ſtir up his zeale to promote the Holy Church, and ſuppreſs its enemies. If this will not do; then comes a Comminatory and Menacing Briefe, capable to ſeize him with a Pannick Fear, and dread of what will enſue. If no effect follows, then an Excommunication is thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt him, reſerved to the Pope himſelf, and, it may be, is backt by an Interdict. Then the Legate or Nuncius again exhorts him to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf out of that deplorable condition, and pretends Power from the Pope to abſolve him from thoſe exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Cenſures, notwithſtanding the reſervation, and to withdraw the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, if he will at laſt acquieſce, and comply with his Holineſs reaſonable intentions. And if he will not yet yield,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:101117:141"/>but perſeveres in his firſt reſolution, then the Legate is called home, and then follows Depoſition; he is deveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his Right to the Kingdom, his Subjects are Abſolved from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him, and he declared Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <hi>Laeſae Majeſtatis Divinae,</hi> ſo that to Aſſaſſinate him in this State, ſhould not be deem'd a Crime. And yet all this argues but an indirect Power on the Temporal Eſtates of Secular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>So it is in our preſent caſe, they pretend only an indirect power to change the nature of the Contract, and whereas it was before mutually obligatory, they declare, that this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation ceaſeth, and that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſhall not be held a Civil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, without any reflection made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacramental Inſtitution, and yet the Council, without any diſtinction, renders all perſons uncapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Clandeſtinely, and declares all ſuch Contracts to be void: <hi>Prout eos praeſenti decreto, irritos facit, &amp; annullat,</hi> which, in effect, deveſts them of their Sacramental Vertue, to which they were, by the Original Inſtitution,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:101117:142"/>deputed, and by this means deſtroys both Contract and Sacrament, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders its production of Grace, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a Supreme Power, to annihilate a Sacrament at pleaſure, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of an indirect power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That this power which they pretend to, is nothing but a groundleſs uſurpation, which I prove evidently: for the original Inſtituter of Marriage, did not ordain it, by a general and confus'd notion, leaving the determination of particulars to the Church, to declare ſome to be void, and others to be valid, as they ſhould deem expedient. But he foreſaw plainly, and diſtinctly, every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar individual, and numerical contract, that in proceſs of time ſhould be made, between ſuch particular and individual perſons, with the particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of time and place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe very particular Contracts he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted ſo Sacraments, and impower'd them to produce Grace, not conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, but abſolutely, without having a regard to what the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould do, ſo as that they did not hang
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:101117:142"/>in ſuſpenſe, to expect till the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> ſhould approve or diſapprove of them; for ſuch an imperfect Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were unworthy of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Infinite Perfections, and would make his will ſubordinate to the will of the Council, and his Inſtitution would be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the Councils determination, for by this means <hi>Christ</hi> would ſtand obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to give, or refuſe his Sacramental Graces, where, and when, and to whom the Council ſhould determine him: which in effect is no other then to make the Omnipotent ſubject, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Council of meer Men, lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Ignorance and Error.</p>
               <p>Now ſuppoſing <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution to be of this nature (which none in his right wits can deny) here is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and irrevocable decree, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Divine Autority, that every particular contract, ſo Inſtituted, ſhall be elevated to a Sacrament, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Grace, which no ſubſequent Council can alter, or fruſtrate <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Decree: and that for Two Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> For want of Power.</item>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> For want of due Order.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Power is wanting, becauſe all Human power is finite and limited, and therefore cannot be in competiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the power of the Omnipotent; due Order is alſo wanting, becauſe <hi>Christ</hi>'s Decree was firmly ſetled, and eſtabliſh'd above Sixteen hundred years ſince; ſo this modern Decree of the Council comes too late to make any change or alteration in it, or any way to repeal or abrogate it. So they may talke of an indirect power of degrading the contract, and depriving it of its wonted obligation, and making it no civil contract, but all in vain, for <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution muſt ſtand.</p>
               <p>Yet it may be Reply'd, That thoſe clandeſtine contracts, which were to be after the Decree of the Council, are no civil contracts, and therefore not comprehended under the number of thoſe that <hi>Christ</hi> Inſtituted as Sacraments.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:101117:143"/>
               <p>I Anſwer, That the Supreame Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, in the Inſtitution of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did not regulate himſelf by any ſubſequent and human Law made in prejudice of his Inſtitution, but well knowing thoſe Clandeſtine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to be of their own nature obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, he confirm'd that mutual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in them, by erecting them to the dignity of Sacraments; which no human Decree can change; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Councils might preſcribe him what Rules they pleaſed, to regulate his proceeding.</p>
               <p>The Second Objection: Since we are deſtitute of any certain knowledge what thoſe Contracts were, that <hi>Christ</hi> Inſtituted as Sacraments, we ought, in this, to take the teſtimony of the Church, for the Rule of our Belief; who, by reaſon of her Infallibility, is beſt able to informe us, and ſecure us from Error: Wherefore, ſince the Church declares all ſucceeding Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Contracts, to be no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor Civil Contracts, we have no reaſon, by our own fallible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to call in queſtion the verity of the Churches Declaration.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:101117:144"/>
               <p>I Anſwer, That the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> not only declares thoſe ſubſequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts to be void, but, as much as in her lies, makes them ſo. <hi>Prout eos preſenti decreto irritos facit, &amp; annullat;</hi> which, notwithſtanding, before this Decree were valid, and obligatory. As for the Church of <hi>Romes</hi> Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, we have in the precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, examin'd it, and found it defective, and ſhall hereafter prove it erroneous; and therefore have no grounds to confide in it. But, in this caſe, we have made it appear, that the determination of thoſe Contracts, which, of their own nature, were Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory, was made, by Divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and that ſuch Contracts were deputed to be Sacraments, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Decree of the Council; yea, and are ſtill reputed Sacraments, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a mutual obligation, here in <hi>England,</hi> and other places, where the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> was never received, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: How then could this ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Decree of the Council, have any influence upon thoſe contracts, which were eſtabliſht as valid, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:101117:144"/>with a Sacramental vertue, by a Divine Decree, that was precedent to this human Decree of the Council? This being but a fruitleſs attempt, to render that invalid, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted as valid, <hi>Jure Divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Third Objection: Clandeſtine Marriage was ever hold unlawful; and therefore they who contract ſo, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſin in doing it, becauſe they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs againſt a precept of their lawful Superiors; and it is not likely that <hi>Christ</hi> would affix his Supernatural Graces to a ſinful action; nay, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that a Mortal ſin, and Grace, can ſtand together in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And therefore the Church might prudently preſume, that ſuch ſinful contracts were not Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> themſelves muſt ſolve this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; for, they all grant, that clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine Marriages were Sacraments, and valid contracts, ever before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and are ſo ſtill in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Saxony;</hi> and yet they ever were, and ſtill are unlawful; which
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:101117:145"/>circumſtance they muſt reconcile with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution; for notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſin, they acknowledge them to have been Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> as Sacraments.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That the circumſtance of contracting clandeſtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is wholly extrinſecal to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and therefore can never alter the nature, nor eſſence of it, for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances make no change in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and this is common to all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; for whoever receives any Sacrament, may, out of the pravity of his own will, add ſome unlawful cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to it, or receive it when his Soul is contaminated with ſin; but we muſt not hence conclude, that this deordinate proceeding of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, layes any infection upon the Sacrament, whoſe compleat ſubſtance and eſſence is wholly independant of the circumſtances, which are extrinſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to it. True it is, that all Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produce Grace, as alſo, that Grace and deadly ſin are wholly inconſiſtent, and therefore, whoſoever receives a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament when he is actually in ſin, puts an Obſtacle to the effect of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:101117:145"/>and cannot then receive any Grace by it; becauſe ſin makes him lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the pains of Hell; and Grace gives him, whoſe Soul it informs, a right to Glory; and becauſe theſe two are incompatible, therefore Grace, and Sin, that are the neceſſary cauſes of them, mutually exclude each other from the ſame Soul. Yet they generally Teach in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> That when the obſtacle is removed, and the Soul purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſin, that then the Sacrament revives, and produceth that Grace, which by the original Inſtitution was annexed to it; and this Doctrine they alſo apply to Moral actions, in reference to Inherent and Sanctifying Grace, which they Merit; for when one fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into ſin, he loſeth all that habitual Grace which he poſſeſt before his fall, it being inconſiſtent with ſin; but when he is again reſtored to the ſtate of Grace, then his Merits revive to render him the ſame quantity of Sanctifying Grace, which he before had loſt by ſin. So is it in thoſe that contract clandeſtine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, if invincible ignorance doth not excuſe them; they ſin, and receive no Inherent and Sanctifying Grace, till ſin, which is the obſtacle be removed; and,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:101117:146"/>in the ſame moment that this is done, the Sacrament revives, and produceth in their Souls its due proportion of habitual, and inherent Grace. See <hi>Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez Opuſcul.</hi> 5. <hi>D.</hi> 2. <hi>S.</hi> 2. &amp; 3.</p>
               <p>And thus have I vindicated the Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of <hi>Clandeſtine Marriage</hi> againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Principles of their own Doctors; and conſequently, that Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> is but a vain attempt, to render that void, which, by Divine Autority, is eſtabliſht as valid; which proceeding is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally drawn from a preſumption of their pretended Infallibility; And therefore whatſoever they decree, though againſt Divine Right, is held as Sacred, and not liable to error, as in this caſe it happens.</p>
               <p>But this is certain, that theſe private Matrimonial Contracts were by <hi>Christ</hi> appointed as Sacraments, or they were not; if not, then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> erred by ever acknowledging them as ſuch; if they were, then the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> errs, by endeavoring to repeal them</p>
               <p>You'l ſay, That thoſe Contracts that proceeded the Council, were Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they were civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, but they which ſucceeded were not,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:101117:146"/>becauſe they were no Civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. Yes, becauſe the Council will have it ſo. But, Who ſees not, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Doctrine, it is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and not <hi>Christ,</hi> that is the proper Inſtituter of this Sacrament? for the Council determines what contracts ſhall be Sacraments, and what ſhall not; the Council determines to what contracts Grace ſhall be affixt, and to what not, which is all that Inſtitution imports, for they would have <hi>Christ</hi> to take his meaſures from them, and would impoſe a Law upon the Will of God, to accommodate himſelf to their will; they order all, and the Word Incarnate muſt regulate himſelf accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, which makes them the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Inſtituters, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental. Which is too great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity, and detracts very much from the perfection of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution. For I demand, What reaſon can be alleag'd, Why <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not, or would not determine all this himſelf? He had a perfect comprehenſion of all that concern'd his Church, which the Council had not; neither can they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was the Principal, nay the only Inſtituter of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:101117:147"/>
               <p>Who then can deny, but that <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by an Irrevocable Decree, determin'd all things relating to the Sacraments, independant of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> many Ages before this Inſtituting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was framed? But, an Error once committed, <hi>per fas &amp; nefas,</hi> muſt be maintained.</p>
               <p>I might here annex an Account of the proceedings of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſome others of their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sacraments; for whereas the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Subdeaconſhip was ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd in the Primitive Church, by the Impoſition of Hands, this is now wholly omitted; and in lieu thereof they have Inſtituted the Tradition of an empty Chalice, and an empty Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene to the Ordained, which argues a total change: So likewiſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirmation, the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors ever Confirmed by the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Hands, without any Uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but now without the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſme, they deem Confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on invalid, and the Forme would be falſe, which is this, <hi>Signo te ſigno crucis, &amp; Confirmo te Chriſmate ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.

               <p>The Firſt Reaſon: Becauſe it was a great irreverence, and a high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Sacred Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which was the price of our Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſee it fall to the ground, and trampled under foot, by thoſe who receive ſo great a benefit by it, and whereunto they ſtand indebted, for the Graces they receive here, and the hope of Glory hereafter; wherefore the high Veneration and Adoration which we owe to the Incarnate Word, preſent in this Sacrament, ought to preponderate all other Conſiderations, which certainly our Redeemer expects from us.</p>
               <p>The Second Reaſon: Becauſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever receives the Holy Euchariſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Species of Bread only, receives all <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well the Blood as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, together with the Divine Word, and all the Sacred Trinity: for
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:101117:150"/>though <hi>ex vi verborum,</hi> by the words of Conſecration, only the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be Sacramentally Conſtituted under the Species of Bread; yet, <hi>per concomitantiam,</hi> by a neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the parts of <hi>Christ</hi> with each other, the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all rendred preſent, under the Species of Bread; ſo that if this Sacrament be once Adminiſtred under the Species of Bread, it were a needleſs repetition to adminiſter the ſame under the Species of Wine; for this were no other then to Adminiſter to the ſame perſon, one and the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing twice, without addition or diminution, which would not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable to the Receiver.</p>
               <p>The Third Reaſon: Becauſe by the words of <hi>Christ,</hi> our Redeemer, Eternal Life is annexed to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of his Body, under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread only; <hi>If any Man eate of this Bread, he ſhall live for ever:</hi>

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:101117:151"/>promiſed to him that eateth of this Bread; therefore, to Receive <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under the Species of Wine, is not neceſſary to Salvation; not <hi>neceſſitate medii;</hi> becauſe the Bread alone is ſufficient, as appears by the words of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> Nor <hi>Neceſſitate praecepti;</hi> becauſe no ſuch Precept is extant; and if there were, then the eating of the Bread alone would not be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to Salvation, which <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf affirms to be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Reaſon: Becauſe it hath ever been the practice of the Church, ſince the Apoſtles time, to Adminiſter the Communion under the Species of Bread only, to thoſe that were infirm, and reduced to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of death, for to theſe the Sacrament was uſually carryed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Species only; ſo likewiſe in Armies, before a Battel was to be fought, the Sacrament was commonly Adminiſtred to them only in one kind; neither is it to be preſumed, that the Church, in its greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, would, not only countenance
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:101117:151"/>men to tranſgreſs againſt <hi>Christ</hi>'s Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but be Inſtrumental alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the violating of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: whence it follows, That <hi>Christ</hi> laid no ſuch Precept upon his Church, nor the Members thereof.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Reaſon: Becauſe in the <hi>Apostles</hi> time, one Species was in uſe, according to the opinion of diverſe of the Fathers, who hold, that <hi>Christ</hi> gave the Communion in one kind, to the two Diſciples that were with him at <hi>Emaus.</hi> So <hi>Auguſtin, Hierom, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Theophylact.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The Deciſion of this Controverſie.</head>
               <p>IN order to the Reſolution of this Queſtion, a threefold Precept is here to be diſtinguiſh'd. There is a Poſitive, a Negative, and a Mixt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; The firſt is a Command of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, for ſome poſitive action is to be exerciſed for the fulfilling of a Poſitive Precept. As by the Fifth Precept of the Decalogue, we are obliged to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that honor and reſpect which is due to our Parents, which we cannot fulfil meerly by abſtaining from actions of diſreſpect and contempt, but by Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive actions of Honor and Duty, though there is no obligation incumbent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, to be always in exerciſe of theſe actions, but only when occaſion requires. A Negative Precept commands us to abſtain from doing ſome poſitive thing, which is prohibited, and if the action forbidden be intrinſecally ill, then the doing of it is <hi>prohibitum quia malum;</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:101117:153"/>if the action of it ſelf be indifferent, then to do it, is <hi>malum, quia prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> This Negative Precept, layes a never interrupted obligation upon us, to obſerve it; as in the Sixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, by which we are obliged to do no Murther; the meaning is, that an act of Murther is not to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither this time, nor that time, nor any other time whatſoever, neither upon this perſon, nor that perſon, nor any other perſon whatſoever; which is to be underſtood univerſally, and by a compleat diſtribution. And herein a Negative Precept differs from a Poſitive. A Mixt Precept includes both the former, of two different ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; as the firſt Precept obligeth us to acknowledg God, and not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any thing elſe for God. And in this is grounded that diviſion of ſins, into ſins of Omiſſion, and Commiſſion. This being ſuppoſed,</p>
               <p>The Firſt Aſſertion is, That the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> never to Adminiſter the Communion to the Laity, in both Kinds, is manifeſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Precept. For Proof hereof I ſhall inſiſt upon that ſaying
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:101117:153"/>of our Saviour, <hi>Amen, Amen, I ſay unto you, except you eate the fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you ſhall have no life in you,</hi> John 6. v. 53. where thoſe words, <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the greateſt aſſeveration, that our Great Redeemer ever uſed, and this adds more force and energie to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Precept. The words cited contain a ſevere Commination, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving us of eternal Salvation, except we eate his Fleſh, and drink his Blood; which by the confeſſion of our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, includes a Precept, though they deny that it extends to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under both Kinds.</p>
               <p>Let us now examine what falls im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately under this Precept.</p>
               <p>None but a Creature, indued with liberty, and reaſon, is capable of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it be poſitive, it injoyns the exerciſe of ſome free action, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Reaſon; ſince neceſſaries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fall under any Precept. If it be Negative, it commands the avoiding of ſome poſitive action, which is in the power of Free-will to exerciſe, or not to exerciſe: we have here a poſitive
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:101117:154"/>Precept, which injoyns all Chriſtians, to eate the Fleſh, and drink the Blood of the Son of Man; which affects im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the free actions of Man, of eating and drinking, and, <hi>in obliquo,</hi> it determines the matter about which theſe free actions are to be exerciſed, namely, the Fleſh and the Blood of the Son of Man. This matter, is not in the power of the Laity, to procure, at their pleaſure, but is to be tendred to them by the Prieſt, which done, then it is in their free election to eate and drink, or not to eate and drink; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe actions are that exerciſe, which the Precept immediately obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to.</p>
               <p>Neither is it left to their choice, how they are to receive this matter; for as the Legiſlator determines the matter, ſo likewiſe doth he determine the manner of receiving it; he doth not ſay indeſinitely, or indeterminately, except you take or receive this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but explicitely, plainly, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, Except you <hi>Eate</hi> the Fleſh, and <hi>Drink</hi> the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by this Precept, they are ty'd up, and determin'd to the very particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it; neither doth the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:101117:154"/>ſay, Except you eate the fleſh, <hi>or</hi> drink the blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but, Except you eate the Fleſh, <hi>and</hi> drink the Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by a Copulative, not a Disjunct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive. So that he who eateth the Fleſh, under the Species of Bread only, though he fulfil the firſt part of the Precept, yet he complyes not with the ſecond part; for though by eating the Fleſh, under the Species of Bread, he receives the Blood alſo, and all <hi>Christ;</hi> yet he doth not <hi>drink</hi> the Blood, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, is as rigorouſly commanded as the firſt, and in as expreſs terms.</p>
               <p>To confirm this, I ſhall, in the next Aſſertion, make it appear, that in drinking the Chalice, there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſignification, and a peculiar bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; which accrues to the Receiver, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſtinct from all that which iſſues from the receiving under the Species of Bread. Which much commends the great love of our dear Redeemer to Mankind, in Commanding us to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive under both Species, that ſo he might give us an entire, and compleat repaſt, and refreſh us with all thoſe Graces, which correſpond to each part thereof: he doth not invite us to this
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:101117:155"/>Banquet of all Delicious Rarities, with intention to feed our Souls by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale, and by halves; but abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poureth forth the Treaſures of his Merit, and Satisfaction, ſo to repleniſh our Souls with a full and compleat refection.</p>
               <p>And to make us the more ſenſible hereof, he choſe to ſuffer that Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Death upon a Croſs, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the effuſion of his moſt Sacred Blood, though he could have wrought our Redemption without either; for though, as purely God, he was not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Satisfaction, nor Merit; yet that Divine Word, having by the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtatical Union, aſſumed Humane Nature, all his actions became The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrical, the leaſt whereof was of an infinite value, capable (without Death or Paſſion) to Redeem a Thouſand Worlds; for though he aſſumed the Nature of Man, yet he took not upon him the Perſonality of Man; there was but one Suppoſitum which was the Divine Hypoſtaſis of the Word of God; and this gave the poyſe and value to all his actions, which proceeded from one Perſon that was both God and Man; as they proceeded from Man
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:101117:155"/>they were capable of Merit, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and as they proceeded from God, they were infinite in both kinds, and ſo never to be exhauſted. So that by one act of love, or any other Moral Vertue, he might efficaciouſly have Redeemed us; and yet he choſe to do it, by a bitter Death, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the better to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the weakneſs and imbecillity of our capacity; for this more efficaciouſly ſtrikes our fancy, and imprints upon our Souls a more ſenſible feeling of his infinite Love towards us. And for a more ample teſtimony hereof, he hath left us his Sacred Body and Blood, to participate thereof; and to taſte of the fulneſs of his Graces and Mercies, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſtill renewing the Memory of his Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Who then ſhall abridge us of theſe Favors, by preſcinding the one halfe, and mincing the benefits beſtow'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, by ſo liberal and munificent a Hand? How great is the preſumption of ſome Men? who call all <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Actions in queſtion, and ſubmit them to the ſcrutiny of their weak indagation. They uſurp his Infallibility, they alter and change his Sacraments, they Repeal
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:101117:156"/>his Laws, they diſpenſe in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Impoſe upon him what he never Ordained: <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye drink the Blood of the Son of Man, ye ſhall have no life in you.</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſaith, Though ye drink not the Blood of the Son of Man, ſo you eate his Body, ye ſhall have life in you. Whom ſhall we believe, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi> Shall we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert a certain Infallibility, to adhere to an uncertain and preſumptive one? Could not the All-knowing Word of God (whoſe Prudence and Wiſdom hath no bounds) foreſee all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, that could, or would come to paſs? And, Could not his Infinite Providence order and diſpoſe all for the beſt? Is it to be preſumed that <hi>Chriſt</hi> left his Work imperfect, or not duly order'd, to be compleated, or reformed by the weak induſtry of Man? Wherefore, by what hath been ſaid, I conclude, That the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in denying the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to the Laity, is an expreſs viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Precept.</p>
               <p>The Second Aſſertion: This kind of half-Communion, Prohibiting the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:101117:156"/>Sacrament under both Kinds, is a high Injuſtice, and very prejudicial and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Receiver. This Aſſertion I prove firſt, becauſe all the Laity, yeà and the Clergy alſo, that are not Prieſts, are rendred uncapable of fulfilling <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Precept, at leaſt as long as they ſhall remain in their Communion; and though the Authors of this Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are highly culpable, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, in denying the Faithful what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath left them, yet the Receivers alſo are tranſgreſſers for not fulfilling <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Precept. But you will ſay, How can they help themſelves, if the Prieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth to exhibit the Sacrament to them in both Kinds? which is not in their power to procure; neither can they be obliged to impoſſibilities. I Anſwer, That they who ſeriouſly endeavor to fulfill <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Precepts, are bound in Conſcience to forſake the Communion of that Church, and to Imbrace the Communion of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, where theſe Sacred Myſteries will be compleatly Adminiſtred to them, for by this means they are capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Command, which they are ſtrictly obliged to do.</p>
               <pb n="288" facs="tcp:101117:157"/>
               <p>The Second Proofe: They who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver receive thoſe Holy Rites but in one Kind, not only tranſgreſs againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Command, but alſo incur the penalty that is annexed to it, which is no leſs than the privation of eternal happineſs, <hi>Except you eate the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you ſhall have no life in you.</hi> And what is conſequent hereto, they are liable to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting torments of Hell. How enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous therefore muſt the Injuſtice be of thoſe that are Inſtrumental: What do I ſay, <hi>inſtrumental,</hi> that are the principle cauſe of reducing men to that extremity, that unavoidably they muſt violate <hi>Christ</hi>'s Command; and thereby incur eternal damnation; and all this by denying them that, which by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, they have right to? Can any Injuſtice be compared to this? Can any damage be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial and injurious to the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?</p>
               <p>The Third Proof: The Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal products of Communion, under the Species of Wine, are very different and heterogeneal from all the Graces and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:101117:157"/>Favors conferr'd upon him, that partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates the Sacrament, in the other kind only; for this Spiritual refection hath a great analogy, and proportionable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude, with the natural repaſt of the Body, and their reſpective operations, are reciprocal correlatives (by way of ſimilitude) with each other; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Original Inſtituter, adapting theſe Myſteries, to the procedure of Nature, congruouſly Inſtituted them under the Symboles of Bread and Wine; the Bread we eſteem to be the Staffe of Mans Life, becauſe it Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſuch vital and animal Spirits, as are the ſubſtantial ſupport of Mans Life: and thereby it gives aliment, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, and growth to the body, which is the principal part of nutrition. The Wine makes the heart glad, and enli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens it, to exerciſe the functions inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to human imploy, with more life and expedition; it alſo ſupplies the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical heat and moiſture with ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acceſſes of its innate qualities, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libutes the veſſels and organs, which are the vehicles of the Spirits, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes them with ſuch proportionable qualities, as are moſt accommodated to expediate the exerciſe of their nutritive
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:101117:158"/>Functions, by compleating the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the oeconomy of Nature in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends for nutrition, by their attractive, diſpoſitive, converſive, and expulſive faculties; and ſo conduceth in a high degree, to nutrition, augmentation, and ſenſation. So the Bread admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth the ſubſtantial matter, that is to be wrought upon, but the qualities of Wine give their immediate aſſiſtance, in all the elaboratories which it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth through, to diſpoſe it, and bring it to its intended end.</p>
               <p>In like manner, by the primary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Sacrament, thoſe Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are drawn from the Maſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Merits, are not inconſiderately diſtributed, but <hi>in pondere &amp; menſura,</hi> with a due regard to the exigency of circumſtances; for though increaſe of Inherent and Sanctifying Grace, be common to both parts of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet the Actual Graces, which are annexed to the one part, are far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe that correſpond to the other; for Communion under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread, Communicates to the Receiver ſuch Actual Graces, as tend to the ſubſtance of the Spiritual, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Life of the Soul; they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:101117:158"/>the underſtanding to a firm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heſion to the Principles of Faith, they move the Will to the practice of Moral Vertues, Piety, and Religion, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and Man. But Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under the Species of Wine, gives proportionable Graces, which though they are vers'd about the ſame matter, yet their tendency towards thoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is in a different manner, for they excite the faculties of the Soul, to the exerciſe of Chriſtianity, with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and alacrity; they give perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and longanimity; they induce the Will to practiſe Vertue, and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, out of the higheſt Motive, of the Love of God above all things. Theſe are the Graces, which put the laſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment to our Spiritual Actions, without which, the former, though they come full fraught with the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and conſiſtent Element of a Spiritual Life, yet in the execution thereof, they are dull and flaccide, and for want of a more vigorous excitation, are the ſooner defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by adverſe Temptations, and Suggeſtions of the Senſual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:101117:159"/>
               <p>Hence we may gather, how much more a whole and adequate Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, conduceth to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Spiritual Life, then an ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate, and half one; for what emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument is it to one to receive a ſtrong, and ſubſtantial food, if his vital fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are not duly qualified to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt it, and converte it into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubſtance? And I would have it obſerv'd, that this Doctrine of the different Graces correſponding to the receiving this Sacrament, under the two different Species, is no product of my weak invention, but is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Poſition of diverſe Learned and Approved Divines of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> and without which, their Principles of the Sacriſice of the Maſs cannot be well managed, as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
               <p>And in this is grounded the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Third Proof: For if we duely ponder, of how great a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and value, theſe ſpecial Graces are in themſelves, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond to the Chalice, and how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing they are to the perfection of a Spiritual Life, and ſencing the Soul,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:101117:159"/>againſt the ſubtile attempts of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, it will be the manifeſt ground of a cleer illation, that to deprive ſo many thouſands of ſuch unſpeakable benefits, is a great Injuſtice, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable prejudice to thoſe, in whoſe favor, the Meritorious cauſe of them, had with ſo much bounty and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, left them as a Legacy, to all ſuch as ſhould worthily receive his moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Blood, under the Species of Wine. The Pope in his Oeconomy, and the Adminiſtration of his Juriſdiction ſeems wholly unmindful of Diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; for to ſome, by his Jubilies, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, and Indulgences, he very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſpoſeth of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Satisfaction, upon conſideration of their comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Orders of His Holineſs; though he be ſparing enough to others. But in arrogating to himſelf a Power of diſpenſing <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Merits, and the fruits of his Paſſion; yea, and to alter <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Inſtitution, by refuſing them to ſuch, as the Author himſelf, had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive them, is too high a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: Muſt we, by Human Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, be deprived of what, by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Giver hath been conſign'd to us? this ſtands in high oppoſition with all
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:101117:160"/>equity, and is beſides, an illegal uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Divine Right. But we now come to ſolve their Objections and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, ſpecified in the precedent <hi>Section,</hi> in defence of this partial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The Objections Solved.</head>
               <p>THe firſt Objection is grounded on the Irreverence, of permitting ſome Particles of the Chalice to fall to the ground, as is ſpecified in the firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the contrary opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I Anſwer, That this Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion removes not that inconvenience, except they forbid Communion under the Species of Bread alſo, and ſo utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclude the Laity from any part of this Sacrament; for there are more Particles loſt from off the Bread, then from the Wine; it being not Morally poſſible to handle the Bread, without ſeparating from it ſeveral Minute Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which did adhere to the Maſs, and yet were not continued, but only contiguous to it, which, on the leaſt motion, fall off, whereof many are ſo ſmall, that <hi>ſugiunt viſum,</hi> and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when a Prieſt in Maſs, divides the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:101117:161"/>Hoaſt, in order to Conſummation; then by reaſon of the Elaſtick Vertue of the Ayre, and the reſiſting quality of the Wafer, theſe Minute Parts muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be carryed beyond the extent of the corporal, and ſo loſt, which no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man care, nor diligence, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That this, and all other circumſtances, which occur in practiſe, were cleerly and certainly foreſeen by <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, deemed it expedient, if not neceſſary, to iſſue forth his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of receiving this Sacrament in both Kinds, who knew full well how far the weak induſtry of Man could reach, to prevent ſuch inconveniences: and for ought we know, may ſend his Angels from Heaven, to collect and take care of ſuch Particles; as ſome of the adverſe Party affirm. And this may ſerve for an Anſwer to the firſt Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Second Objection: He that complies with a Precept, <hi>quoad ſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam,</hi> though he ſhould not be ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect as to be punctual in all things,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:101117:161"/>
                  <hi>quoad circumſtantias,</hi> yet he may truly be deemed to have complyed with the command, and is no tranſgreſſor; but he who receives in one Kind only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well the Body as the Blood, which is the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Precept; therefore he is no Tranſgreſſor.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor; He that complyes with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>quoad ſubſtantiam,</hi> although he obſerve not the Circumſtances, fulfils the Precept, if the Circumſtances be the Object of the Precept: I deny the Major: If the Circumſtances fall not under the Precept; I grant it: but in the preſent caſe, the eating and drinking compared to the Precept, are the very ſubſtance thereof; though in reference to the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they are but Circumſtances; for the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Precept, are, <hi>materia circa quam,</hi> the eating and drinking are <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria quae:</hi> this is the very thing that is commanded, for they are the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man actions, which are immediately un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Precept: the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ</hi> are the Matter about which theſe
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:101117:162"/>actions are verſt, for to fulfil this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, it is not ſufficient to eate and drink any thing, but it is neceſſary to eate the Body, and drink the Blood of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> it is not in the power of the Seculars, to procure or Conſecrate the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but when it is exhibited to them, it is in their free election, to eate the Fleſh, and drink the Blood; which by this Precept they are obliged to. As by the Fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Decalogue we are injoyn'd to keep holy the Sabbath day, that is, to abſtain from ſervile labor, and to exerciſe acts of devotion, but the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept doth not determine what acts of devotion we ſhall in particular exerciſe, for this is left to our free election, either to hear Divine Service, or hear the Word of God explained, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our time in Spiritual Reading, or in Prayer and Meditation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here the alteration of the Circumſtances, hinders not the fulfilling of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; and therefore in this caſe the Argument proceeds rightly.</p>
               <p>But our Caſe is far different, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Legiſlator determines us to particular actions, and leaves it not in
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:101117:162"/>our election to change them, or to omit either of them. So he that takes the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> and doth not eate the one, and drink the other, fulfils not the Precept. And this anſwers the Second Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Third Objection: He that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives under the Species of Bread, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives all <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and may be truly ſaid to eate the Fleſh, and drink the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſo ſatisfies the Precept; according to that of <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sermone de Coena Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note> 
                  <hi>Potus &amp; eſus ad eandem pertinent rationem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That he who receives only under the Species of Bread, though he receive the Blood as well as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet cannot be ſaid to drink the Blood, under that Kind; for that which is eaten, is commonly ſolid and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; but nothing can be taken by way of drinking, except it be a ſluid and a liquid matter; wherefore, to receive under the Species of Bread, is not to drink the Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> except you grant, that one may drink dry bread.</p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:101117:163"/>
               <p>To the Authority of <hi>Cyprian</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That in the ſame Sermon he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove the Evangelical Precept of eating the Fleſh, and drinking the Blood of Chriſt, by the ſame Text; <hi>Except you eat the Fleſh and drink the Blood,</hi> &amp;c. where he hath theſe words, <hi>Lex eſum ſanguinis prohibet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Evangelium praecipit ut bibatur:</hi> whereby he expreſly declares his ſentiments, to be coherent with ours. In the words above cited, he rather confirms then impugnes this Doctrine; for he declares, that eating and drinking belong both to this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the Spiritual refreſhment of the Soul, in the nature of one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Banquet, which without Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be imperfect, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Objection: Admit the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of a Precept to receive in both kinds; yet to avoid the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before-mentioned, the Superiors of the Church, according to the pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial dictates of a right Government, may, and ought to frame an Epikeia, by a grounded interpretation of the Will of the Law-giver, that if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:101117:163"/>to be conſulted herein; he would declare his intention, not to have his Law executed on ſuch hard circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; which excuſes the Governours, in denying the promiſcuous uſe of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and exempts the Subjects from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſgreſſors.</p>
               <p>Firſt I Anſwer, That upon the ſame ground, they may alſo prohibit Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under the ſpecies of Bread, for the ſame difficulties are militant for this, as well as for that, as hath been proved.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, That Divine Laws admit of no Epikeia, nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Divine Will, but when God commands, Man muſt obey. The reaſon is, becauſe we cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe any defect in the Omniſcience of the Divine underſtanding, who perfectly penetrates all future events, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantial emergencies, before they come to paſs, with as much infallible certainty, as if they were then preſent; ſo that here is no ground at all for the prudential dictates of humane Reaſon. But humane Laws upon extraordinary accidents, may admit of an Epikeia; becauſe the wiſeſt Legiſlator among
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:101117:164"/>Men, is ſuppoſed to be ignorant of future contingencies, and yet ſuch may happen, wherein a rational Judgment, not byaſſed by ſiniſter Motives, may deem it imprudence, <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi> to have the Law put in execution, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may rationally interpret the Will of the Law-giver, to ſuſpend the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Law, under ſuch arduity.</p>
               <p>But however ſuch caſualties may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, yet humane Laws ſuffer no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereby; for upon removal of ſuch hard circumſtances, the Law revives, and obliges to its obſervance as much as before. How then can it be conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Reaſon, that meer Men ſhould not only ſuſpend the execution of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, upon an incident occaſion, but prohibit the obſervance of it to all, but Prieſts, conſtantly, and for perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity; ſo that all but Prieſts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barr'd from the obſervance of this Law for ever? This is an attempt of a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nature, for hereby they endeavour to abrogate and repeal this Law, as much as in them lies, for ever, which argues a bold and daring preſumption, very injurious to the Divine <hi>Conditor Legis.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:101117:164"/>
               <p>The Fifth Objection is grounded in thoſe ſayings of Chriſt, where he only mentions the Bread, and promiſeth Eternal Life to them that eat it,<note place="margin">John <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> as the Third Reaſon propoſeth. I Anſwer, That in the ſame Chapter, our Lord having diſtinctly explained his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more then once, of eating his Fleſh and drinking his Blood, thought it needleſs to repeat all the particulars, as often as he mentioned this Sacrament: ſo that the meaning of thoſe Texts is, he that eateth this Bread worthily, and in the manner as I ſhall preſcribe, or as I have preſcribed, ſhall live eternally; otherwiſe, if the meer eating of that Bread were ſufficient to Salvation, then an unworthy Receiver might be ſure of Eternal Life, which illation all muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And this anſwers the Third Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Objection is drawn from the practiſe of the Churh, in its primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and pureſt times, which was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter this Sacrament to thoſe that were to fight a battle, and to ſuch as were in danger of death by infirmity, in one kind only, whence it enſues, that both kinds are not neceſſary, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der precept, which is the Fourth Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:101117:165"/>
               <p>I Anſwer, That the precept which we inſiſt upon being poſitive, it doth not oblige to receive under both kinds, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> neither doth it determine how often we are to receive under both kinds, but leaves this to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Church, and the Piety and Devotion of the Receiver; ſo that by Receiving ſome times in our Life, or ſo often every year, under both kinds, we fulfil the precept, and that being done, the receiving after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards under one kind, can be no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the precept, it being an act of Devotion not prohibited; but he that never receives under both kinds, all his life time, is a manifeſt tranſgreſſor. And ſo the Fourth Reaſon is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               <p>The Seventh Objection is in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the ſame with the former, only this induceth the authority of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, upon the Texts cited in the Fifth Reaſon; where by breaking Bread, they underſtand this Sacrament. I Anſwer, That the Diſciples in thoſe times lived in common, and gave up their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals into the common ſtock, and took their refection in common, ſo
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:101117:165"/>that their coming together to break Bread, means, their Meeting together to take their Corporal repaſt. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Receiving under one Kind, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on particular occaſions, proves juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, in order to this queſtion, becauſe the Precept may, at other times be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, by receiving under both Kinds, which the Fathers no way impugne.</p>
               <p>But if you conſult the Fathers, you ſhall find many of them abetters of this Opinion. <hi>Chriſostom</hi> ſpeaking of the practiſe of the Old Law, wherein it was not lawful for the people, to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of that part that was reſerved for the Prieſt, adds theſe words, <hi>Sed nunc non ſic: verum omnibus unum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus proponitur, &amp; unum poculum.</hi>

               <p>IT is the uſual practiſe of our Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts, when they apprehend any Dogmatical Point conducing to their intended deſign, they caſt about them, and ſummon all the ſtrength of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they can muſter up, to eſtabliſh that Principle. But if the ſame Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in another occaſion, ſtand in their way, and obſtruct the evincing of ſome other Theſis, then they, with all ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous induſtry, apply themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, and cry down the ſame Point, which they had before, ſo elaborately ſtrived to make good. As in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to make out the legality of their half Communion, How do they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devor to deveſt the drinking of the Blood, of all its Prerogatives, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Graces, peculiar to that kind alone, as though it were ſuperfluous;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:101117:167"/>and after receiving under the Species of Bread, it were but <hi>actum agere,</hi> to Adminiſter the Chalice? Yet when they treat of their Sacrifice of the Maſs, then the conſummating of the Chalice is held in great veneration, and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to neceſſary, that rather then omit it, they muſt lay hold of any hard ſhift, and have recourſe to extremities; for which no reaſon can be alleaged, except they grant the Chalice its due, and allow its efficacy and operation, as proper to it ſelf, which in this Diſcourſe we ſhall make plainly appear.</p>
               <p>The approved notion of a Sacrifice is this, <hi>Immutatio facta circa rem aliquam creatam in agnitionem Supremi Dominii.</hi> It is a change made about ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thing, in acknowledgment of the Supreme Dominion; and according to this definition they infer the Maſs to contain <hi>verum,</hi>

                  <hi>proprium, &amp; propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Sacrificium,</hi> as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> declares, A true, proper, and Propitiatory Sacrifice; for in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating of the Bread and Wine, there is a proper Converſion, or Tranſmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the ſame, into the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and theſe are alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:101117:167"/>by the Sacrificater; all which is performed, by way of a Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of that bloody Sacrifice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Author of Life offer'd himſelf upon the Croſs, to his eternal Father, as a Propitiation, for the ſins of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>Yet to compleat this unbloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it is not ſufficient, that the Prieſt do conſummate the Hoaſt, under the Species of Bread, but it is alſo rigorouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and indiſpenſably neceſſary, that he alſo conſummate the Chalice, under the Species of Wine, and therefore, in caſe a Prieſt, after having Conſecrated the Bread and Wine, and Conſummated the Hoaſt, ſhould by any ſudden acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or indiſpoſition of Body, fall down at the Altar, and be rendred wholly unable of Conſummating the Chalice, under the Species of Wine, in this caſe they are to uſe all poſſible means, ſuddenly to procure another Prieſt, and if none could be found that are faſting, yet rather then faile, they muſt appoint one that is not faſting, to Conſummate the Chalice (and yet without ſuch an immergent neceſſity, it is eſteemed a heinous crime, for any one to preſume, to receive this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:101117:168"/>except he be faſting) the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof is, becauſe the Sacrifice ſhould not remain imperfect; for the Offering up an incompleat Sacrifice to the Author of all Being, is held a great abomination, and a diſreſpect to God, and therefore a leſs inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt yield to a greater; for, <hi>ex duobus malis, minus eſt eligendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being ſo, I now come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ground of this indiſpenſable neceſſity. Why is the Conſummating the Chalice ſo rigorouſly requir'd? They Anſwer, To compleat the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. I again demand, What is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the compleating the Sacrifice? They Anſwer, The Receiving under the Species of Wine, which, in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice hath been Conſecrated. Here I muſt alledge their own Arguments, which they ſo induſtriouſly urge, to excuſe their denying the Chalice to the Laity For, ſay they, he who receives under the Species of Bread, receives all <hi>Chriſt;</hi> not only the Body, but the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Natural Union, the Divine Word, the Hypoſtatical Union, and the whole Trinity; therefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive again under the Species of Wine
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:101117:168"/>is ſuperfluous; it is <hi>actum agere,</hi> he had all before, and more he cannot have; ſo that the ſecond reception, is but a bare repetition of the former, without addition, or diminution.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine (which is their own) I apply to their Sacrifice. When the Prieſt hath Conſecrated in both Kinds, and Conſummated the Hoaſt, I ſtill preſs to know, What is wanting to compleat their Sacrifice? Nothing can be aſſign'd, but the Conſummating the Chalice. But I Reply, The Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cater hath already Received all <hi>Chriſt,</hi> nothing excepted, What would he have more? for, to Conſummate the Chalice, is but to receive the very ſame again; it is but an unneceſſary Repetition; it is <hi>actum agere,</hi> whereby nothing is received, but what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived before; and therefore if any thing be wanting to Compleat the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, it muſt be ſome Spiritual Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or Emolument that the Chalice brings with it. In fair Arguing, ſome reality ſhould be aſſigned, for bare words are not ſatisfactory; and if they pretend, that there are any, peculiar Graces, or Spiritual Favors, which
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:101117:169"/>accrew to the Receiver, under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Wine, diſtinct from thoſe that are received by Communion, under the Species of Bread (as many of their great Divines affirm) then they give a Legal Reaſon of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcating the receiving of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under both Kinds. <hi>Amen, Amen, dico vobis,</hi>

               <p>But if they grant this, How then can they excuſe their Injuſtice of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Cup to the Laity? for theſe Graces are of a high value, and of right belong to them, as is more largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared above,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> in this Diſputation. So that they are here reduced to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity: If they grant theſe Spiritual Graces to the Chalice, they cannot excuſe their Injuſtice to the Laity. If they deny them, they cannot make out their practiſe and Doctrine of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs. Theſe are hard
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:101117:169"/>ſhifts to defend a bad Cauſe; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they have moſt reaſon, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly acknowledge, the Graces confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon us, by receiving the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> under the Species of Wine, which ſo much conduce to the right Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Chriſtian Life, and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in it.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore caſt a glance of compaſſion, on the deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe, that live in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who not only are deprived of ſuch Spiritual Graces and Favors, but by a conſtant Rebellion againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Commands, are become refractory and incorrigea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in their diſobedience, and which is worſt of all, hereby incur the penalty threatned to the diſobedient, by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf; which is no leſs then eternal Damnation; neither is it poſſible (as long as they remain in thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances) to make their Peace or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement with All mighty God; which can never be effected but by a valid Abſolution, or a true Repentance; but if they reſolve to continue in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, they are neither capable of a valid Abſolution, nor a true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:101117:170"/>for two eſſential impediments that cannot be removed; obſtruct and render inefficacious all their endeavors. The one is an incapacity of retractation, the other an impoſſibility of a purpoſe of amendment: for, How is it poſſible for any one to retract his ſin, or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to amend, as long as he is delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and firmly reſolved, to continue in the ſame ſin? for ſuch a reſolution, is wholly inconſiſtent with a retractati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with a purpoſe to amend, and yet theſe two are both neceſſary to a valid Abſolution, and to a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which is allowed by all.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore conclude this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation with this enſuing Sillogiſme: They who are tranſgreſſors, and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of a valid Abſolution, and true Repentance, cannot be ſaved: but they who are reſolved to continue in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are Tranſgreſſors, and incapable of a valid Abſolution, and true Repentance; <hi>ergo,</hi> They who are reſolved to continue in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> cannot be ſaved. The Major none can deny, it being conſonant to the Doctrine of both Churches, and evident in it ſelf. The Minor hath
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:101117:170"/>been ſufficiently proved in this Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But, How diſmal, and fatal is the conſequence, to thoſe whom it concerns? They have no remedy but one, which is, to ſeparate from that Church, which reduceth them to ſuch extremities, and then they may be in a Capacity to Repent, and exerciſe Acts of Attrition, and Contrition, ſo to reduce their Souls to a better ſtate.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> Doctrine relating to <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHoever intends to make a ſtrict Inquiry, into all the Parts of this ſtrange Myſtery, muſt of neceſſity Conſult the Grounds of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> on which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; where, in the firſt place, they adhere to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> whoſe <hi>Principles</hi> are more accommodated to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:101117:172"/>then any other; for they abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely except againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Carteſius,</hi> and reject his Principies, who compoſeth this ſublunary World or one ſimple Compleat ſubſtantial Body, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of no ſubſtantial Compoſition, either of Matter, or Forme, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther equivalent parts, but divides this Body into integral parts, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to Three Claſſes;</p>
               <p>The One he calls, <hi>Globulos Caele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another, <hi>Materiam Subtilem;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Third, <hi>Particulas Stria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which, though according to their own Entities, are Homogeneal, yet by reaſon of their different Figures, Motions, and other Modifications, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all that variety, and thoſe Heto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneal effects, which this World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth to our Corporal Senſes. And though he often mentions Local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Moodes, and Modiſications, yet he would never admit any accident, either abſolute or modal, no firſt or
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:101117:172"/>ſecond qualities, entitatively, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſtinct from the ſubſtance; as his Writings ſufficiently declare; and alſo, as I have been ſeveral times informed, by Doctor <hi>Gutſcouen,</hi> a Doctor of the Univerſity of <hi>Lovaine;</hi> and Canon of the Cathedral of <hi>Liege,</hi> who was <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his boſom Friend, with whom he Communicated all his Principles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he Printed them. Who aſſured me, that <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was an irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Enemy to all Accidents, Moods, and Qualities, really diſtinct from the Subſtance.</p>
               <p>This therefore being waved, they ſtick cloſe to the Peripateticks, who admit Moods, Qualities, and Accidents, really diſtinct from the Subſtances which they affect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In all Compleat Bodies, in this Sublunary World, they admit a Subſtantial Compoſition, of Matter and Forme, ſo as that the firſt Matter, being produced by a creatain Action, is indifferent to all Formes, but depends on no one in particular; and therefore ſince the firſt Creation of the World (if we Conſult Nature) no Matter hath been produced, none deſtroyed. But
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:101117:173"/>on the contrary, the ſubſtantial Forms have a ſtrict dependance on the firſt Matter, as their proper Subject, and on ſeveral qualities and accidents, as their Natural diſpoſition, ſo that if their Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be Annihilated, or their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition deſtroyed; by the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> they could not ſubſiſt, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them Teach, that the Heavens, Planets, and Fixt Stars, admit of no ſuch Compoſition, but are Compleat, yea ſimple ſubſtantial Bodies, which cannot be diſſolved but only into Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gral, and Homogeneal parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They Aſſert, That though according to Nature, the ſame Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Body, cannot be in more then one place, at the ſame time; yet that by Divine Power, one and the ſame Body, may be collocated in ſeveral and diſtinct places, the ſame moment of time, how diſtant, and remote ſoever theſe places are, the one from the other. Which is far different from the Manner, how the Soul of Man exiſts in the Body, for though the ſame Soul be at the ſame time in the head, and in the foot, and becauſe it is a Spirit, and hath no ſubſtantial, nor integral parts, it muſt
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:101117:173"/>of neceſſity be all in the head, and all in the foot, and other parts of the Body, the ſame inſtant, becauſe it is indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; yet, in this Caſe, the whole Body is but one adequate place of the Soul; for if the head ſhould be ſever'd from the Body, the Soul could not in that ſtate of Separation, be both in the head and the Body, no not for one moment of time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They agree in the notion of Subſtantial Converſion, that it is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of one Subſtance into another, which they diſtinguiſh into two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; the one is a partial, or inadequate Converſion; the other a total or ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate Commutation. The firſt is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and proper to the preſent order of Nature; for in all the Changes that we obſerve, of ſeveral Subſtances deſtroy'd, and others produc'd, there never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens but a partial Converſion: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, We ſee Wood, or other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Matter, Converted into Fire, the Form of Wood is deſtroyed, but the Matter, as being ſuſceptible of any Form, remains under the Forme of Fire, that was before under that of Wood: So that you ſee, in all theſe Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:101117:174"/>one part is deſtroy'd, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſiſts in being; ſo in that which ſucceeds, one part is newly produced, but the other was extant before. But in a total Converſion, the precedent ſubſtance is wholly deſtroyed, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Annihilated, and the Forme Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the ſubſequent ſubſtance, which ſucceeds in place of that which is deſtroyed, both Matter and Forme, is all Collocated under the ſame Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Accidents, either by a new production, or elſe by an adduction; for if this ſubſtance, into which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was Converted, were before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, then there needs only a new Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the place, where the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is made, without relinquiſhing its former <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bi,</hi> or place where it was exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent; and ſo is now in two diſtinct places at once; and this total Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can never be made, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing the Laws of Nature: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Nature can ever lay a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, determining to the deſtruction of the firſt Matter, which depends upon no diſpoſitions, but is produced by a Creative action, independant of all things elſe. And therefore its deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:101117:174"/>exceeds the power of all Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes. Then the Conſtituting of a Body, in two diſtinct and adequate places at once, is not in the power of Nature, as all grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> They grant, That Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Qualities, Diſpoſitions, and all other Accidents, cannot naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without a Subject, or Receptacle to ſupport them, and keep them in being; for, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>Accidens eſt ens in alio,</hi> or <hi>entis ens;</hi> it is ordained by Nature to be ſubſervient to ſubſtance, and ſo is not intended for it ſelf, but to diſpoſe the ſubſtance to ſeveral Changes and Mutations, upon which it hath conſequently a ſtrict depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; neither can it have any uſe in Nature, without the Subſtance. So that Accidents cannot remain without a Subſtance, but by the Miraculous aſſiſtance of a Supernatural Power, and where this intervenes, they maintain, that all Accidents, except Moodes, may be conſerved, in being without a Subject.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſeveral Points of Doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing premiſed, they conclude, That in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, by the words of Conſecration, which are theſe,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:101117:175"/>
                  <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my Body;</hi> which are pronounced by the Prieſt, aſſuming <hi>Christ</hi>'s Perſon, there is wrought a total, ſubſtantial Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which they call <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> ſo that the whole ſubſtance of Bread, both Matter and Forme, is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroyed: and the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body is really pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, in lieu of the Bread, which is really Converted into the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet ſo, as that the Species of Bread (which is the collection of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, that were before in the Bread) keep their ſtate of being (though the Bread be deſtroyed) and are Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly preſerved without a Subject; though they are Sacramentally united to the Body of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And though, <hi>ex vi verborum,</hi> only the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> be rendred preſent, nothing elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſignified by the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, nor requiſite to verifie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitance, and Connexion, whereby all the parts of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are united with each other, there is alſo put, under the Species of Bread, the Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Soul of <hi>Christ,</hi> with the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:101117:175"/>Natural Union between his Body and Soul, the Divine Word, the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union, which Connects the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word to the Humanity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently all the Sacred Trinity, are all there really Exiſtent, under the Species of Bread; which Species or Complex of Accidents, were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and conſerved before the Bread was deſtroyed, by an Action called <hi>Eduction;</hi> that is, a production de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on another, to wit, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread, to which they were the natural diſpoſition; but that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance being deſtroyed, they are now conſerved by another action, which they terme <hi>Creation;</hi> that is, a produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction independant of all others. By the Species of Bread they underſtand, the Heat, the Cold, the Dryeth, the Moyſture, the Quantity, the Rarity, the Denſity, the Colour, the Odour, the Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were all appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to the Bread.</p>
               <p>They alſo Affirm, That theſe ſtrange Wonders are wrought by the words of Conſecration, which are Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to this purpoſe, and by
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:101117:176"/>their Obediential Power, are elevated to effect, what of themſelves they are uncapable of, the Divine Power Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operating with them, to accompliſh this deſign; ſo that theſe few words, pronounced by a Prieſt, who aſſumes <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Perſon, and Officiates in his Name, are not only repreſentative, but alſo practical; they effect what they ſignifie, and ſo reduce themſelves to a Conformity with their Object, which makes them true.</p>
               <p>But it may be demanded, In what Critical Moment of time this great Change is made? For the words, though few, yet are pronounced by the Prieſt ſucceſſively, whence the doubt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, Whether this ſtrange Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be made in the beginning, the middle, or the end of the words of Conſecration? To this they Anſwer, That during the time that the Prieſt is pronouncing thoſe words, nothing is done, till he pronounceth the laſt Syllable of the laſt word <hi>meum,</hi> and in that moment the whole buſineſs is effected, and the Prieſt no ſooner hath
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:101117:176"/>ſpoken that laſt ſyllable, but he kneels to Adore <hi>Chriſt</hi> then preſent, and Elevates the Hoaſt, to ſhew it to the People, that they alſo may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it.</p>
               <p>Another Query may be propoſed, How long the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> remains in the Hoaſt, under the Species of Bread? Their Anſwer is, That as long as the diſpoſitions of Bread remain there, ſo long is <hi>Christ</hi> preſent; but when by contrary Cauſes, theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Accidents are ſo far Chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Forme of Bread could not Naturally there ſubſiſt, then the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is withdrawn.</p>
               <p>This is a ſhort, but true Account of their Tenets: whence they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That by ſuch a <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as is above explicated, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread is truly and really Converted into the Body of <hi>Christ;</hi> and this they propoſe to all to be Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, as an Article of Faith.</p>
               <p>The Grounds of this Paradoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:101117:177"/>Doctrine we ſhall propoſe in the Objections, againſt thoſe Aſſertions which we are going to eſtabliſh in the next <hi>Section.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. II.</hi> The Orthodox Doctrine againſt <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation</hi> propoſed and proved.</head>
               <p>THe Firſt Aſſertion: The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as it is Taught by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is <hi>de facto,</hi> falſe, and Erroneous. I add thoſe words <hi>de facto,</hi> becauſe in this Concluſion, I only deſign to prove, That no ſuch <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be admitted, waving the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of it; but I ſhall afterwards prove that it is wholly Chymerical, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and the Proofs of that Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will confirm this.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Proofe: <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not into the World to deſtroy, but to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and therefore was ſo zealous to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Old Law; and certainly he ſtood not in oppoſition with his Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was the great Framer, and Conſerver of the Univerſe, who conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted it in its due order, by providing
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:101117:178"/>for the proper Nature, propenſions, and inclinations of each part thereof, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining the Natural Cauſes, Effects, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties, and Paſſions of all things, and by that provident ſubordination of one thing to another, in relation to the good and conſervation of the whole. But this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> cannot be defended, but by violating thoſe Laws of Nature (eſtabliſhed by God himſelf) in a high degree, for in every Conſecration, there are as many Miracles, which infringe the Laws of Nature, as there are Minute Accidents, and Qualities exiſting without their Subject; it is a Miracle that the Forme of Bread ſhould be deſtroyed, and its diſpoſition entire, contrary to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Nature; it is a Miracle, and againſt Nature, that the firſt Matter ſhould be annihilated, nothing in the Univerſe determining to it; it is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be in ſo many places the ſame time; it is a Miracle, that the Words of Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (a meer Sound from a Mans Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan) ſhould be elevated to effect ſuch Prodigies. And in moſt places ſubject to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> there is a never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted continuation of all theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:101117:178"/>products, by keeping the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Hoaſt in a Cyborium, within the Tabernacle, which is never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Nay, What a Prodigious Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Miracles are daily and hourly multiplyed, by ſo many Millions of Hoaſts as are continually Conſecrated, in the whole extent of the Univerſe? Who can be ſo impious, as to impute ſo horrid a Fraction in Nature, to <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf? as though he waged War with his Eternal Father, by endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſubvert the Order, and Nature of this Univerſe, contrary to its firſt Inſtitution; all which being duely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, who can be ſo great a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of his own Reaſon, as blindly to inſlave it to ſuch incredible Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?</p>
               <p>The Second Proof: If the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread were really Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated into the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Species of Bread ſhould remain without a Subject, that Collection of Species would be wholly incorruptible; and conſequently <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body would never be ſeparated from that Hoaſte, where it is once preſent. The Illati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I prove evidently, for if that Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:101117:179"/>of Accidents exiſt independant of any Subject, and are preſerv'd by a Creative Action, then no Natural Cauſe, nor Agent, could have any influence upon them, for no Natural Agent can operate, but in order to ſome Subject, which muſt receive and ſupport the effect produced: wherefore admit that a Conſecrated Hoaſte were applyed to the fire, the Species of Bread extant in the Hoaſte, would ſuffer ſome Change, or Alteration, by the influence of the fire; ſuppoſe then one degree of heate to be produced in the Hoaſte, then one degree of cold muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from thence, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to heate; if ſo, then that degree of Heate which the fire produced, muſt be Created, and not Educted, becauſe there is no ſubject at all to receive it, and ſo it muſt exiſt as the reſt of that Complex doth, independant of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and that degree of cold that is deſtroyed, muſt be annihilated, not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, for it is deſtroyed independant of any Subject. What then, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Doctrine, Muſt we admit that a meer Creature, and a Natural cauſe, as the Fire, hath a power to create, and annihilate? you were as good ſay, that
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:101117:179"/>a Creature may be Omnipotent, for hitherto I never heard but of one Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, God himſelf, who alone hath power to Create, and Annihilate: What is this but to rob God of his Prime Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and communicate them to his Creatures? But, What remedy? for manifeſt experience ſheweth, that a conſecrated Hoaſte is as liable to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, change, and corruption, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is not conſecrated; ſo there is no way but one, to ſalve all theſe inconveniences, which is, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> out of which thoſe groſs errors inevitably follow.</p>
               <p>But it may be Objected, That the proper Subject of the Species of Bread, is the quantity, and not the ſubſtance it ſelf, for the quantity is the ſubject of other qualities, and common accidents, and that alone is Miraculouſly conſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Euchariſt, without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That the proper function of quantity is to communicate impenetrability to the Bodies that it affects, for two Bodies meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, reſiſt each other, and cannot be
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:101117:180"/>both penetrated in the ſame place, as our Soul is with our Body. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from quantity, which is the root of impenetrability. Beſides, that is the ſubject of the common accidents, which is by them diſpoſed for ſeveral Formes; but it is only the ſubſtance that is ſo diſpoſed (for quantity is of it ſelf but an accident) therefore the common accidents are received in the ſubſtance, and not in the quantity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That all the School of the <hi>Thomists,</hi> all the School of the <hi>Scotists,</hi> and a great part of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and other Authors, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> do abſolutely aſſert, that the ſubſtance, and not the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, is the proper ſubject of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon accidents, and conſequently the Argument proceeds in its full ſtrength againſt all theſe.</p>
               <p>The Third Proof: Inſiſting upon the Principles of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> an irreconcileable difficulty will occur; when that complex of firſt, and ſecond qualities, and other accidents is ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and changed, that it becomes an apt diſpoſition to a new ſpecifical
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:101117:180"/>Forme. As for example: A Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant receives a conſecrated Hoaſte, which is log'd in the Stomach of the Receiver, and by the natural activity of the Stomach is fitly diſpoſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Forme of Chyle, then there is a ſtrict exigence in nature, that the Forme of Chyle be introduced; What is to be done in this caſe? Nature may ſpend it ſelf in clamoring to have this Forme introduced, but alaſs, here is no ſubject, nor receptacle to receive it. Some expedient muſt here be found, you will ſay, that in this caſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature muſt create new Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to receive this Forme, and to relieve the Accidents from that violent ſtate wherein they have been detained.</p>
               <p>Moſt excellent <hi>Philoſophy!</hi> How ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd would this ſeem to any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, but meanly verſt in this Science? <hi>Aristotle</hi> never dreamt of ſuch anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtreſſes of Nature. And the <hi>Divinity</hi> is yet worſe; which makes God ſubject to ſubmit to the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant exigences of his creatures, no way grounded in his own Providence, and Diſpoſition; for the great Author of Nature, Created the whole Maſs of firſt
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:101117:181"/>Matter, independant of any thing elſe, and ſince that original creation, no Matter hath been deſtroyed, none pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, but the ſame ſucceeds indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, to all the variety of Formes that are produced and deſtroyed. But now here comes a ſtrict exigence of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Forme, to be produced depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the Matter, and yet there is no matter to receive it, but the Supreme Creator muſt be ſummoned by his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſupply this defect, by Creating new Matter, as though he had been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the Beginning, what quantity of Matter was ſufficient, who created all things by his Infinite Wiſdom, and Providence, <hi>in pondere, &amp; menſura,</hi> out of his own Free-will, without any exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or determination of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Muſt then the Order of this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme be inverted? and God, (as it were) neceſſitated, to exerciſe his Omnipotence in a New creation, not grounded in his former Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</p>
               <p>But here it may be Alleg'd, That the drift of all theſe Proofes, is no
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:101117:181"/>other then to make it appear, that the whole buſineſs of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is Supernatural and Miraculous, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, and are induced to this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, by the Autority of <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who, holding Bread in his hand, in the Laſt Supper, plainly told his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my Body:</hi> If <hi>Chriſt</hi> affirms it, Who dares gainſay it? We all know, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread cannot, by Natural Means, be converted into the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> but by the illimited power of God, it may be done; and <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells us, That it is done, Why therefore ſhould we not believe it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That what is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, though Miraculous, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, may be believed, yet not ſlightly, and without ſufficient reaſon; but if by an urgent and indiſpenſable neceſſity, or an irrefragable autority, which brings with it a perfect aſſurance, of the true ſenſe, and meaning thereof, we are preſſed to an aſſent, this is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Motive to induce us to believe</p>
               <pb n="338" facs="tcp:101117:182"/>
               <p>But, in the next Proofe, I ſhall make it appear, that here is no ſuch inductive, no neceſſity of yielding our aſſent to ſuch a prodigious number of Miracles, not once only, but daily and hourly repeated, and conſtantly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and ſo to laſt till the Worlds end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That in the Second Proofe of this Aſſertion, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that from this Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> it unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, That all Natural Cauſes, both can and do actually create, and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate, who promiſcuouſly have their inſluences, when duly applyed, upon a conſecrated Hoaſte, as much as they have upon one that is not conſecrated; which plain experience maketh mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; and to have ſuch a power to create and annihilate, or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſomething out of nothing, is ſo peculiar to God alone, as wholly depending on an Omnipotent Power, that it is abſolutely impoſſible, that it ſhould be communicated to any pure creature.</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:101117:182"/>
               <p>The Fourth Proofe: There is no neceſſity, neither from Scripture, nor Reaſon, nor from any other Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to admit <hi>Tranſubſtantiation.</hi> The greateſt neceſſity that hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto alledged, is drawn from thoſe words of <hi>Christ, Hoc eſt corpus meum:</hi> but from hence no neceſſity can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived; for, they that hold <hi>Conſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> and aſſert, That <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body exiſts in the Sacrament, together with the Subſtance of Bread, theſe, I ſay, as rigorouſly ſtand to the literal ſenſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words, and as properly verify them, as they who hold <hi>Tranſubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for the words of themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply no converſion, or change of one ſubſtance into another; but, if taken in a literal ſenſe, they only ſignifie <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body there preſent: wherefore there is no neceſſity, from theſe words, to multiply ſo many Miracles, yea, and Impoſſibilities, as are inferr'd from <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> becauſe the literal ſenſe of the words may be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
               <pb n="340" facs="tcp:101117:183"/>
               <p>But in reality there is no more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of underſtanding thoſe words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a literal ſenſe, then when he ſaith, <hi>I am a Door, I am a Vine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For, ſince the Scripture is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſo many Senſes and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, there is no Reaſon, nor Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, of wreſting it to that ſenſe alone, which brings with it the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt difficulties of any, eſpecially when by congruities, and other places of Scripture, it may be connaturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in another ſenſe; and ſince it was uſual with our Great Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to ſpeak by Allegories, Parables, by Tropes and Figures, it is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſpoke ſo here; which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently intimated by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Diſciples, <hi>John.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 63. that, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing; the words that I ſpeak unto you, are Spirit and Life;</hi> and yet the words that he then ſpoke were concerning his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:101117:183"/>
               <p>Hence I Conclude. That the words of <hi>Chriſt</hi> above reherſed, can ground no neceſſary inference of <hi>Tranſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>IN order to the determination of this difficulty, I muſt firſt premiſe, That according to the Rules of <hi>Logick,</hi> no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative propoſition, or enunciation, can be true, except it have a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with its Object, that is, the Object muſt be in its ſelf, as the act repreſents it.</p>
               <p>All Enunciations conſiſt of two parts, the ſubject, and the predicate; the ſubject is that of which it enunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates; the predicate is that which it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciates of the ſubject: if the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be negative, it ſeparates the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate from the ſubject; but if it be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, it intentionally identiſies the one with the other, as in this Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Angelus eſt Spiritus; Angelus</hi> is the ſubject, and <hi>Spiritus</hi> is the predicate; the act being affirmative, repreſents theſe two as identified; and becauſe in
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:101117:184"/>the Object they are identified, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Propoſition is true: But if the two extreams were not identified, yet poſſibly might be, then the act were <hi>in materia contingenti,</hi> that is, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently falſe; but if they were not iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, nor by any power could be iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, then the Propoſition were <hi>in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria remota,</hi> that is, neceſſarily falſe. This being ſuppoſed,</p>
               <p>The Second Aſſertion is, That <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> as grounded on the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of this Propoſition, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> is impoſſible, and Chyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical.</p>
               <p>That I may be rightly underſtood in the Proofe of this Aſſertion, I deſire it may be obſerved, that in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this diſcourſe, I ſhall always take the Propoſition in queſtion, in a literal ſenſe, according to the natural and plain ſignification and meaning of the words, as underſtood by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts</hi> themſelves, who take it lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; wherein I ſhall firſt prove the true ſignification of the Subject, and then of the Predicate, whence I ſhall cleerly deduce the truth of this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <pb n="344" facs="tcp:101117:185"/>
               <p>The Subject of this Propoſition, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> is that which is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the word <hi>Hoc,</hi> which I thus prove to be the ſubſtance of Bread: That which was actually preſent when the word <hi>hoc</hi> was pronounced, is the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or thing ſignified thereby; But the ſubſtance of Bread was the only thing preſent, when the word <hi>hoc</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; <hi>ergo,</hi> the ſubſtance of Bread is the Object, or thing ſignified thereby. The firſt Propoſition, or Major, cannot be reaſonably doubted, for that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>hoc</hi> being demonſtrative, it indicates and ſhews its Object as preſent; for that which is abſent or not exiſtent, cannot, in any propriety of Speech, be ſignified by the word <hi>hoc,</hi> or <hi>this:</hi> as if the <hi>Author</hi> of a <hi>Book</hi> ſhould hold one of the Copies in his hand, and ſhew it to thoſe that were preſent, ſaying, <hi>This is my Compoſition:</hi> Could any one in his right wits doubt, but that by the word <hi>this,</hi> he ſignified the Book which he held in his hand? wherefore, that which <hi>Chriſt</hi> held in his hand, and ſhewed to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> muſt neceſſarily be the thing ſignified by the word <hi>hoc.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:101117:185"/>
               <p>The Minor, or Second Propoſition I prove thus: That which was preſent when <hi>Christ</hi> pronounced the Word <hi>hoc,</hi> was that which he held in his hand, and ſhewed to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> which was only Bread, under its proper Species, for in that moment, the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not there, under the Species of Bread, as our <hi>Antagoniſts</hi> themſelves confeſs, who conſtantly affirm, That the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is not rendred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent under the Species of Bread, till that inſtant wherein the Propoſition is compleatly ended, and the reaſon is, becauſe till that inſtant, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſignifieth the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is made preſent by the force and energia of the ſignification of that Propoſition, which they ſay, is elevated to be iuſtrumental in producing its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and by that means concurs to its own verity. Therefore <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body not being preſent under the Species of Bread in that inſtant, it remains, that only the ſubſtance of Bread was then preſent in <hi>Christ</hi>'s hand, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that alone was the Subject of that Propoſition, whoſe Predicate was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or enunciated of it.</p>
               <pb n="346" facs="tcp:101117:186"/>
               <p>The Predicate of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Propoſition, which is, <hi>Corpus meum, my Body,</hi> plainly and explicitly ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> who pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the Propoſition, and ſaith of that Bread, which he then held in his hand, that it was his Body, and therefore I ſhall not detain you in proving the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> to be the thing ſignified by the Predicate, eſpecially ſince our Opponents grant it, to make good their Tenet.</p>
               <p>Having proved the true meaning and ſignification of the Subject of the forenamed Propoſition to be Bread, and our Adverſaries granting the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented by the Predicate to be the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> let us now examine the ſenſe and meaning of the whole act: <hi>Christ</hi> holding Bread in his hand, ſaith, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> that is, this Bread is my Body, as hath been proved; and the Propoſition being Affirmative, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally affirms <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body to be really identified with that Bread, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the word <hi>this,</hi> becauſe no Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Propoſition can be true, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Subject and Predicate thereof be identified, <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:101117:186"/>this identity, the act can never be conformable to its object, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the truth of it; whence it comes to paſs, that the Propoſition in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taken in a literal ſenſe, according to the true and genuine ſignification of the words, without Tropes and Figures, cannot poſſibly be true; which I prove thus,</p>
               <p>An identity between Bread, and the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> is impoſſible and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical; but the Propoſition in Queſtion affirms an identity between Bread and the Body of <hi>Christ; ergo,</hi> the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Queſtion affirms that which is impoſſible, and chymerical. The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or Second Propoſition, is plain and evident, by what hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy proved, and granted. The Major or Firſt Propoſition, I ſhall here prove; all identity between two Subſtances ſpecifically and individually diſtinct, is as impoſſible, as a <hi>hyrco-cervus,</hi> or <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centaurus,</hi> as they call them, that is, a down-right Chymera: the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it involves a contradiction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one Member formally deſtroys the other; for the notion of identity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two objects, conſiſts in this, That the one hath <hi>omnia &amp; ſola illa quae aliud
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:101117:187"/>habet,</hi> all the perfections and predicates of the other, and nothing more; but the ſubſtance of Bread hath not all the perfections and predicates of the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> for it wants Organizations, Life, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and hath a ſpecifical forme, which <hi>Christ</hi> hath not; therefore if theſe two were identified, the one would have all that the other hath, (which idenity implyes) and the one would not have all that the other hath, by reaſon of their ſpecifical diſtinction, which is a plain contradiction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Affirmative formally deſtroys the Negative; and, <hi>econtra,</hi> the Negative deſtroys the Affirmative. Again, that Bread, and the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividually diſtinct, and an <hi>individuum</hi> is that which is <hi>indiviſum in ſe, &amp; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum à quolibet alio;</hi> indiſtinct in it ſelf, and diſtinct from all others; but if thoſe two individuals were identified, each of them would be diſtinct from all other, and would not be diſtinct from all other, which is a formal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and therefore all ſuch iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities between two, are impoſſible, and chymerical, and ſo I have proved the Major of the laſt Syllogiſme; whence I conclude, that this Propoſition, <hi>Hoc
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:101117:187"/>eſt corpus meum,</hi> taken literally, affirms that which is impoſſible, and chymeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and therefore cannot ground a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al change, or converſion; and ſo <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> as grounded on this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, is wholly impoſſible, and a meer Chymera.</p>
               <p>This Proofe I efficaciouſly confirm thus: Either that Particle <hi>Hoc</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſubſtance of Bread, or it doth not; if the former, then it affirms an identity between Bread, and the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is a Chymera, and all the foregoing diſcourſe ſtands firm and immoveable; If the latter, then with aſſured confidence I declare, that there is not the leaſt ground or appearance of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> to be drawn from that ſo often reiterated Propoſition, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum,</hi> which I prove evidently.</p>
               <p>All Converſions, and Tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether partial or total, whether <hi>Tranſubſtantiations,</hi> or <hi>Tranſaccidentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> eſſentially import two extreams, the one is <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> the other, <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus ad quem,</hi> and a Medium that paſſeth from one to the other, as in our preſent caſe the Bread is <hi>terminus a quo,</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:101117:188"/>the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> becauſe the Bread is ſaid to be Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or <hi>Tranſubstantiated</hi> into the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> ſo that the Bread is deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſucceeds in heu thereof; the Medium is that col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Accidents which are proper to Bread, and under which the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread exiſted before it was deſtroyed, and after, the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> exiſts under the ſame collection of Accidents.</p>
               <p>Now, if the foreſaid Particle <hi>Hoc</hi> do not ſignifie the ſubſtance of Bread, then it is moſt manifeſt, that in the whole propoſition, there is not the leaſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of Bread, but only of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which the Predicate expreſſeth; and the Copula, or Union, repreſents nothing, but only intentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally unites, or identifies the two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams; and there is nothing elſe in the whole propoſition but the Subject, which is the Particle <hi>Hoc;</hi> therefore if this do not ſignifie Bread, then there is nothing that ſignifieth it in the whole propoſition.</p>
               <p>Whence I infer, That the aforeſaid propoſition, doth no way ſignifie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, or make the leaſt mention of
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:101117:188"/>
                  <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> no, nor doth it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford the leaſt ground to infer it from thence, becauſe it mentions no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams really diſtinct, no <hi>terminum à quo,</hi> no <hi>terminum ad quem,</hi> no Change, nor Tranſmutation, but only ſignifies the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> there, not as <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ad quem,</hi> for this is correlative to another extreame, which is <hi>terminus à quo;</hi> but this it not at all ſignifieth. How then can it adminiſter any the leaſt ground to aſſert <hi>Tranſubstantiation?</hi> Here I appeale to the Judgment of any indifferent, or impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> though but meanly capacitated, how a Propoſition can be capable to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſuch an aſſured belief of <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> which notwithſtanding it doth not in the leaſt ſignifie.</p>
               <p>It enſues therefore, That as the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> in thoſe times did uſually ſpeak in Parables, Tropes and Figures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So our Great Maſter (who in moſt things accommodated himſelf to the preſent times) did frequently expreſs himſelf by Parables, Emblems, Tropes, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and particularly in this paſſage, whereof the words, as you ſee, can in no ways bear a literal ſenſe, eſpecially,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:101117:189"/>becauſe we find ſo much congruity for it, in other paſſages of Scripture, where our Saviour calls it Bread, <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 51. <hi>I am the living bread, if any Man eate of this bread. The bread that I will give you is my fleſh:</hi> And, How can it be underſtood in a litteral ſenſe, that Bread ſhould be the fleſh of <hi>Christ? v.</hi> 58. <hi>This is that bread which came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe, and diverſe other ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Redeemer, can in no wayes be underſtood in the rigor of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but are to be expounded according to the congruity of the Subject; for the Bread was a fit Emblem of the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> and equivalently the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was by <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf, elevated to be a Sacrament; and, as Bread feeds the Body of Man, ſo the Sacramental effect thereof feeds the Soul, by ſuch Spiritual Graces as incline to Vertue and Piety, and by fencing the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and the Will againſt all Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Vice and Iniquity.</p>
               <p>Again, the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> by Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf in that Bloody Sacrifice upon the Croſs, was the Meritorious Cauſe of thoſe Graces, and Spiritual Food of our Souls, and ſo it was congruouſly Figur'd by Bread, which feeds the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:101117:189"/>Body; and for this reaſon it was fitly Inſtituted in this Sacrament, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Paſſion; and therefore our Lord himſelf tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 63. <hi>That it is the Spirit that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, the fleſh profiteth nothing:</hi> And again, <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, are ſpirit and life;</hi> and ſo ought to be underſtood, in a Myſtical ſenſe, and not according to the ſound of the Letter; for by participating of this Sacrament, we become Members of the Myſtical Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and are, as it were, made one with him; ſo that the Bread being Inſtituted as a Sacrament, and thereby adapted to produce all theſe effects, it is equivalently the Body of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>THe Firſt Objection: In this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, <hi>Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my Body:</hi> the Subject, which is the word <hi>Hoc,</hi> hath no determinate ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; for when it is pronounced, it neither repreſents the Bread, nor the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but its true meaning is ſuſpended, till the Propoſition be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated, and then whatſoever is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Predicate, muſt alſo be the object of the Subject; ſo that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate ſignifying explicitly the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> the Subject, or the Particle <hi>Hoc</hi> ſignifies the ſame implicitly; and ſo the Predicate being identify'd with the Subject, the Propoſition is true. And in this manner all definitions are predicated of the things defined; for that which the <hi>definitum</hi> ſignifieth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly, and obſcurely, the definition declares explicitly and diſtinctly.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:101117:190"/>
               <p>This is a ſtrange kind of new Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, which will not bear the Teſt of the weakeſt Sophiſter, nor ever get admittance into any Academy: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Firſt Anſwer is, That in all vocal Propoſitions, the ſubject hath its certain and determinate object then, when it is pronounced, whether it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the ſame clearly, or abſolutely, which is not material; for if the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate could determine the ſubject to have the ſame object with it ſelf, no affirmative propoſition could be falſe, becauſe the ſubject, and predicate would be alwayes identified. But, in caſe of equivocation, as in this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Canis est animal latrabile;</hi> where the ſubject <hi>canis</hi> equally ſignifieth more things then one; for it indifferently ſignifies an Animal called a Dog, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Dog-Star, and it ſignifies a Dog-Fiſh: In this caſe, I ſay, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference of the word <hi>canis</hi> muſt be determined, either by the preſent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, or by the predicate; as if one with his finger ſhould ſhew an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal called a Dog, and ſay, <hi>hic canis,</hi> then the indifference would be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to that Species only, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation would be taken off. So
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:101117:191"/>likewiſe by the predicate, <hi>Animal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trabile,</hi> the indifference of the word <hi>canis</hi> would be determin'd to one kind only; but note, that the predicate can never draw the ſubject to ſignifie any thing beyond the extent of its proper ſignification, for the word <hi>canis</hi> muſt of neceſſity ſignifie one of the three kindes above ſpecified, and nothing elſe. So in the Propoſition in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> the word <hi>Hoc</hi> is determined of its own nature to ſignifie that which it then indicates as preſent, be it what it will; but can never ſignifie a thing abſent, or not then in being; much leſs can its ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication be ſuſpended, when it is once pronounced, for here is no equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but this hath no place in the Mental Propoſition of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which regulates the Vocal, becauſe <hi>in mente nulla datur aequivocatio,</hi> there can be no equivocation in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to whoſe act the Vocal muſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond. And if we could ſee the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Act of him that ſpeaks (as the Angels do) all equivocation would ceaſe. What is added of a definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in relation to the <hi>definitum,</hi> or thing defin'd, is of no force, for the
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:101117:191"/>
                  <hi>definitum</hi> hath its determinate ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before the definition is enuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it; but the definition declares diſtinctly the <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>diſſerentiam</hi> of the thing defined, which the <hi>definitum</hi> involves in obſcurity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That inſiſting upon the Doctrine of this Objection, no Converſion, nor Tranſmutation can be any way grounded in that Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for if the Subject, when pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſignifie nothing, and when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is compleatly ended, it ſhould ſignifie the ſame with the Predicate, Where then could they find the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams of Converſion? when there is but one and the ſame thing ſignified by both; no Medium expreſſed, not the leaſt intimation of a <hi>tranſitus,</hi> or paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from one extreame to another. This would ruine their main deſign, of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting <hi>Tranſubst antiation</hi> as a legal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference out of that Propoſition.</p>
               <p>But it may be Reply'd, That by the aforeſaid Propoſition, the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is aſſerted as preſent, which was not ſo before, for it paſſeth <hi>à non eſſe ad eſſe,</hi> from not being, to being.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer, That all Converſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:101117:192"/>two poſitive termes, the one <hi>à quo,</hi> the other <hi>ad quem<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>but all things that are ceated, or produced, which imply no Converſion, yet the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their production, is <hi>primum quod ſic,</hi> and the inſtant immediately before, is the <hi>ultimum quod non,</hi> as the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> terme them, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes, a paſſing from not Being, to a ſtate of Being; yet this imports no Converſion of one thing into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is therefore impertinent to ground <hi>Tranſubstantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Second Objection proceeds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the notion of identity, as it is explicated above, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. where it is ſaid, That they are identified, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one hath all the predicates and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the other, and nothing elſe. Whence it would follow, that no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative Propoſition would be true, but only definitions, as this, <hi>homo est animal cationale.</hi> Man is a reaſonable ſenſible Creature; which is the whole Eſſence of Man. But the other four predicables, as <hi>genus, differentia, propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; accidens</hi> could have no place, becauſe they produc't but part of the Eſſence, and ſo the one hath not all the perfections that the other hath; as,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:101117:192"/>
                  <hi>Homo eſt Animal, Homo est Rationalis, Verbum ſactum est caro,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I Anſwer, That this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie depends not upon that notion of identity; for any other proper ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of identity, would be as ſubſervient to it, as this, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would retain their full force; for the ſubſtance of Bread, can in no proper ſenſe, be ſaid to be identified with the Body of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, directly to the Objection: And deny, that any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice would hence acrew to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicables: for this Propoſition, <hi>Homo est Animal,</hi> contains two Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical concreats, <hi>videlicet, Homo,</hi> and <hi>Animal;</hi> and it muſt be thus reſolved, <hi>Habens Humanitatem eſt habens Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem,</hi> where the <hi>rectum</hi> of the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, is identified with the <hi>rectum</hi> of the ſubject, for it is the ſame <hi>habens</hi> in both caſes. As in Phyſical concrets; <hi>Album est frigidum;</hi> which is thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>Habens albedinem est habens frigiditatem.</hi> Where the <hi>habens,</hi> which is the <hi>rectum</hi> of the ſubject, hath <hi>omnia &amp; ſola illa,</hi> which are contained in
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:101117:193"/>the <hi>rectum</hi> of the Predicate; and ſo of all others of the like nature. That Propoſition, <hi>Verbum factum eſt caro,</hi> is much of the ſame nature; for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>Verbum,</hi> and the Predicate <hi>factum caro,</hi> both ſignifie <hi>in recto,</hi> the Divine Hypoſtaſis, whoſe perfect identity ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Propoſition true. But ſuch Propoſitions, as enunciate a Phyſical Abſtract of its concrete; as this, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum eſt frigiditas,</hi> &amp;c. ſuch acts, are all falſe, for want of identity. But this Diſcourſe is purely Logical, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I leave it.</p>
               <p>The Third Objection: If one ſhould preſent another, with a Box of Jewels, ſaying, <hi>This I give you:</hi> the word <hi>this,</hi> ſignifies that which is in the Box, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it not; ſo that the Propoſition renders this ſenſe, <hi>That which is in this Box I give you:</hi> So when our Redeemer ſaid, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> the word <hi>this</hi> only ſignifieth that which was preſent under that Collection of <hi>Species,</hi> but expreſſeth it not: as if he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>That which is contained under theſe Species is my Body.</hi> Where no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made of Bread.</p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:101117:193"/>
               <p>I Anſwer: This is the ſame that hath been already Solved, though Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in a New Dreſs: which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a great Divine of the Society of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> much inſiſts upon,<note place="margin">Edw. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſley in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript.</note> and renders <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Propoſition thus, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentum ſub his ſpeciebus eſt corpus meum.</hi> My Anſwer is, That whatſoever was contained under the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread then preſent, when the word <hi>Hoc</hi> was pronounced, was the true Object there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but nothing but the ſubſtance of Bread, was then contained under the Species of Bread, then preſent; <hi>ergo,</hi> nothing but the ſubſtance of Bread was the true Object thereof. For in order to the aſſigning the true Object to that Particle <hi>Hoc,</hi> it is not pertinent to examine, whether that Object be explicitly and diſtinctly, or only impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly and obſcurely ſignified.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Objection: There are other concurring teſtimonies of our Saviour in Scripture, beſides that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, which ſufficiently prove <hi>Tranſubstantiation;</hi> as, <hi>The Bread that I will give you is my fleſh; Except you cate the fleſh of the Son of Man,</hi>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:101117:194"/>&amp;c. all which ſignifie the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be given in the Sacrament, the Bread being deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>I Anſwer. The firſt Text ſignifieth, in a literal ſenſe, that Bread is the Fleſh of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is already proved im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; the ſecond makes no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bread, but only of the Fleſh of <hi>Christ,</hi> which concerns the Real Preſence, but not <hi>Tranſubstantiation;</hi> which is the only queſtion now in hand.</p>
               <p>And to avoid unneceſſary Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I Averre, That no one Text of Scripture doth declare any Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Commutation of the Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of <hi>Christ;</hi> which is the main thing to be proved, in order to <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation,</hi> for this cannot ſubſiſt without ſuch a Converſion.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Objection: The Divine Power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath converted Water into Wine; hath fed Five Thouſand with five Loaves and two Fiſhes: where he either Converted the Ayre into Bread and Fiſh, or elſe replicated the Loaves and Fiſhes, and ſo put them in ſeveral places at once.</p>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:101117:194"/>
               <p>And by the Power of God's Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod was turned into a Serpent: Why then ſhould we refuſe our Aſſent to his turning Bread into his Body?</p>
               <p>The Anſwer: We do not at all Queſtion the Power of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, who can work greater Wonders then theſe; nay, the Creation of this Globe of the Univerſe, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced out of nothing, was a greater Proof of God's Omnipotence; but, we deny the thing of Fact; that <hi>Christ</hi> hath actually changed Bread into his Body; which we have no ground to Believe; and as our Opponents defend it, we conceive it impoſſible.</p>
               <p>Another Objection may be taken from the Autority of the Fathers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome ſeem to affirm, others to deny. But their Opinions make no Articles of Faith; and though we reverence their Autority, yet we deem it not expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in this place, to ſcan the drift of their reſpective ſayings.</p>
               <p>Only this in General: Their uſual expreſſions of this Sacrament, are,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:101117:195"/>That it contains the Symbole, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, the Type, the Antitype, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, the Sign, the Image of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt ſtand in oppoſition with the Real Preſence of the thing it ſelf.</p>

               <p>HAving Treated of <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which imports a real Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> I now come to Inſtitute a Diſcourſe of the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi> For though a Converſion of that nature, by force of the words of Conſecration, which ſhould verifie the ſame words, in a literal ſenſe, be wholly impoſſible, as hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; yet I do not deny, but that in the Treaſury of Gods Omnipotency, there is contained a Power to Conſtitute the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> Really Preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, praeſcinding from the manner how it is done; which if it be by a Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:101117:196"/>it would invert the Order of Nature in a high degree, and multiply a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious number of Miracles, without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.

               <p>IN theſe later Centuries from <hi>Christ,</hi> various Queſtions, and Difficulties have been agitated, concerning the Euchariſt, wherein both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending parts might prudently have ſpared themſelves the trouble, of rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch conteſts, no way beneficial to a Chriſtian Life, nor neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>As <hi>First,</hi> Whether the ſame Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is in Heaven, be True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Really, or only Virtually, and Figuratively, preſent in the Sacrament? What need ſo Hot a Debate of this Queſtion, to perplex the Minds of the Well-meaning Vulgar? who might as ſoon obtain Heaven, by their Implicit Faith, as after ſo long a protracted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, with ſuch Heate and Animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on both ſides, in order to the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:101117:197"/>of this Queſtion; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, neither is, nor ever will be determin'd, ſo as both Parties will Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce.</p>
               <p>For, ſuppoſing the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> to be only Virtually, and Figuratively preſent; yet, by its being there <hi>in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> there are as many degrees of Grace, both Habitual, and Actual, produced in the Soul of the Faithful, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiver, as if it were Really, and Corporally preſent: there are the ſame Spiritual Benefits, and Emoluments, to advance its progreſs in Vertue, and its tendency towards Eternity, in both caſes.</p>
               <p>For, as in <hi>Baptiſme,</hi> the Lotion, which is duly applyed by the Baptizer, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution, Sanctifies the Soul of the Baptized, expels Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, and gives him a Right to the Inheritance of Glory; and yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Matter ſtill remains a meer Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Element of Water, as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and the Immediate Matter, which is the Application of that Water to the Baptized, is of it ſelf a pure Natural Action: though by Vertue of <hi>Christ</hi>'s
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:101117:197"/>Inſtitution, theſe Natural things acquire a Power, to produce ſuch Supernatural effects, as pure Nature cannot pretend to. So likewiſe in the Euchariſt, the Natural ſubſtances of Bread and Wine, have the ſame capacity, of being eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Sacrament, by <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and conſequently of being inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, to produce thoſe Spiritual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which, by Divine Inſtitution, are annexed to the due receiving of this Sacrament, as well as the Natural Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Water; for whether the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Christ</hi> be really preſent or not, yet certain it is, that he is there by his Vertue, by his Divinity, and by his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, and will as aſſuredly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon the worthy Receiver, thoſe Spiritual Guifts, which he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as if he were in verity, and reality preſent by his Body.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> tenaciouſly aſſerts the <hi>Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body in this Sacrament, and hath raiſed it to an Article of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, Fulminating an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all thoſe who ſhall deny it. So the Council of <hi>Trent; Si quis negave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>

So that they have made it an Article of Faith, and thrown their Curſe upon all that ſhall deny it; and yet many Thouſands there are, among the ignorant Vulgar, of both Sexes, who, after this definition, cannot give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difference, between the Real, Virtual, and Figurative being of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body in this Sacrament, and ſo muſt ſtill have recourſe to their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith, as much as if there were no ſuch definition. And how much this Belief of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth to Salvation, I leave to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the impartial <hi>Reader;</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing what hath been already ſaid.</p>
               <p>But this is not all; for out of this deciſion of their Councils, there iſſueth another Quaery; for ſuppoſing the <hi>Real
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:101117:198"/>Preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, a Natural doubt ariſeth. What is become of the ſubſtance of Bread that was there before? Here <hi>Authors</hi> are divided, into three different Claſſes; ſome place the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> here by <hi>Tranſubstantiation,</hi> others by <hi>Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,</hi> others by <hi>Impanation.</hi> The firſt Teach, that the ſubſtancee of Bread, as well Matter as Forme, is deſtroyed, by a Natural Exigence of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being placed there, becauſe two compleat Corporeal Subſtances, cannot be naturally, in the ſame place, the ſame time. The two laſt Opinions Teach, That the ſubſtance of Bread remaineth together with <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body, and differ only in this, That they who hold <hi>Conſubstantiation,</hi> aſſert the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> to be with the ſubſtance of the Bread; whereas the Authors of <hi>Impanation</hi> Teach, The Body of <hi>Christ</hi> to be contained in this Sacrament inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, becauſe the ſubſtance of bread, with its proper accidents, as it were, covers and veiles it ſo, as to render it uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being perceived by any Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Senſe. So that the body of <hi>Christ</hi> being Miraculouſly Superinduc't, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bib'd within the ſubſtance of the bread,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:101117:199"/>and penetrated with it, and therefore not pervious to Senſation.</p>
               <p>In this variety of Opinions, Who ſhall be the Umpire? Certainly none more accommodated for this Function, then the great Oracle of the Univerſe. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe grand Prerogative of Infallibility, will take off all ambiguity of the truth of her deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Thus then ſpeaks the Council of <hi>Trent. Quoniam autem Chriſtus Redemptor noster, corpus ſuum, id quod ſub ſpecie panis offerebat, verè eſſe dixit; ideo perſuaſum ſemper in Eccleſia Dei fuit, idque nunc denuo ſancta haec Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus declarat, per conſecrationem panis &amp; vini, converſionem fieri totius ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiae panis, in ſubstantiam corporis Chriſti Domini noſtri, &amp; totius ſubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae vini in ſubstantiam ſanguinis ejus quae converſio convenientèr &amp; propriè <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>OTher Difficulties of like nature are frequently diſcuſſed by their Divines, but not yet determin'd by the Church; as Firſt, By what means the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is made Corporeally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the <hi>Euchariſt?</hi> Whether by a new production, really diſtinct from that which conſerves his Sacred Body in Heaven; or elſe by a new ubicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they call adduction? if the firſt, then the Body and Soul of <hi>Christ</hi> muſt be created anew, and the Natural and Hypoſtatical Unions muſt terminate new eductive actions, really diſtinct from thoſe whereby they exiſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I remember to have Read a Book Written by one <hi>Tho. Barton,</hi> alias <hi>Anderton,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh Jeſuite,</hi> wherein he earneſtly contends to eſtabliſh this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; but I alſo heard others of the ſame Order, to object againſt him,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:101117:201"/>That according to his Opinion, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word, would be as often Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate again, as there ſhould be Hoſts Conſecrated; for every Conſecration ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues a new Incarnation becauſe, though the Hypoſtatical Union be ſtill the ſame, yet the action which produceth it, is wholly new. So that the common O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their Divines, is, That all the parts of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> acquire only new <hi>ubies,</hi> or ubications, whereby the Body, the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with their reſpective actions (the very ſame that are in Heaven) are rendred preſent in the Sacrament, and without leaving their Station in Heaven, they do by every Conſecration acquire a new place, and whereas they exiſted but in one place before, they now exiſt in two places at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>Hence ariſeth a Second Difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the nature of this <hi>ubi,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Body of <hi>Christ</hi> is exiſtent under the <hi>Species</hi> of bread; and the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether it be <hi>ubi circumſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> or <hi>ubi definitivum?</hi> that is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the body of <hi>Christ</hi> exiſt in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> as it doth in Heaven, having all its parts duly ordered and colloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:101117:201"/>in their diſtinct ſtations, with their natural diſtances, conjunctions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguities to each other, as human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are here framed, ſo as that the Hand imployes one part of the ſpace, the Foot another part, the Head ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or elſe whether the whole body be in the whole ſpace of the Hoſt, and the ſame whole body in every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct part and particle of the Hoſt, as a reaſonable Soul is wholly in every part of a Human body: if ſo, then the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the Sacrament, hath a definitive ubication, whereby all its parts are penetrated, and ſo involved and implicated within each other, that an Angel cannot cull out a particle of the Hoſt, how ſmall ſoever it be, and that no ſenſe can perceive it, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And this Opinion they incline to.</p>
               <p>A Third Queſtion occurreth: How long the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> together with the Soul, the Divinity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> remain in the Conſecrated Hoſt? There are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Anſwers to this Queſtion; but the common gives this Rule, That as long as the natural <hi>Species</hi> of bread re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Hoſt, ſo long, and no longer
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:101117:202"/>the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there preſent; ſo that what alteration ſoever is made in the Hoſt, by natural cauſes, if the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſuffer not ſo much change, as would render it uncapable to ſuſtain the ſubſtantial forme of bread, ſo long the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> remains there; but when by contrary Agents, the laſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the forme of bread is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd, then the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws, and relinquiſheth its <hi>ubi,</hi> not by a local motion, but by a meer deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that ubication, without acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any new one, but is reduced to his former ubication, without paſſing from Earth to Heaven. And though before the deſtruction of the accidents of bread, the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in Heaven, and here on Earth, the ſame time, yet after that deſtruction, it exiſts only in Heaven, and yet never tended, by a local and ſucceſſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from Earth towards Heaven; nor ever penetrated, the Air, nor the Heavens, to obtain his place in the Emperial Heaven, becauſe it had that place before. This is the ſum of their Doctrine.</p>

               <p>Theſe Three Difficulties, though much agitated by their Divines, yet are not fully determined by their Church. Only the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> touches upon the Second, and Third, but leaves the Firſt to the litigation of the Schoolmen. Of the Second,<note place="margin">Trid. Con.

The ſame is declared, <hi>Seſs.</hi> 23. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp; Seſs.</hi> 21. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. which is conformable to the Council of <hi>Florence, In Decreto Eugenti ad Armenios;</hi> yet none of theſe places define the manner how <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body exiſts in this Sacrament, whether definitively, or Circumſpectively, but only aſſert all <hi>Christ</hi> to be in each part.</p>
               <p>As to the Third, The Council of <hi>Trent</hi> decrees the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be preſent, immediately after Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:101117:203"/>but reſolves nothing, how long it continues there; for thus ſaith the Council,<note place="margin">Trid. Seſs. <hi>33.</hi> Can. <hi>4.</hi>

                  <hi>SECT. III.</hi> The Inutility of Multiplying Definitions of this nature.</head>
               <p>ANd now, if ſome impartial, and unbyaſſed Judge, were to deliver his Opinion of theſe, and the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I would propoſe to his Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What Grounds, or Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps can be found in Scripture; in the Practiſe, or Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> or in all the Tranſactions of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,</hi> or the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> for ſo Rigorous, and Comminatorious deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch ſubtile and nice Points, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo great a Penalty? and I am ſure none can be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Caſt a glance upon the effects of theſe new-framed Articles of Faith. What Benefit, or Emolument, doth accrew to Chriſtianity by them?
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:101117:204"/>Do the Graces of <hi>Christ,</hi> flow from the Sacraments, more plentifully, by vertue of thoſe Definitions then they did before? This cannot be alleged; for the meaſure of Grace, was taxed and determined by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inſtitution, with reference to the diſpoſition of the receiver. Do they conduce to the better inſtitution of a Chriſtian Life? Do the Faithful the more adhere to the due obſervance of Gods Law? Do they promote Vertue and Good Life? Do they check the illegal progreſs of the Licentious? Do they cry down Vice, and Wickedneſs? Do they add any new Motives to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the Old Man, and ſhun Senſuality? Do they excite to the regulating our Actions, by the Conduct of a juſt Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſis, inſtructed with true Reaſon, and to reject the ſuggeſtion of ſenſe? not the leaſt of theſe products do iſſue from them.</p>
               <p>Nay, on the contrary, Do they not add more load to the Conſciences of the Faithful? who are bound to Believe what they comprehend not. Do they not enthrall and enſlave their Souls to be liable to the Belief of ſuch
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:101117:205"/>a long Catalogue of nicities, or elſe be damned? What a dreadful thing it is, to implicate Mens Minds, and Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into ſuch an unextricable labyrinth of ſollicitude, anxiety, and confuſion, when they ſhall conſider, that of ſo many definitions, if they disbelieve but one, though they believe all the reſt; nothing remains for them, but the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſlames of Hell Fire? And yet they are wholly ignorant what it is they ought to believe, for you were as good endeavor to waſh a Blackamore white, as to go about to make the common vulgar of both Sexes capable of the true meaning of thoſe points, which are ſo remote from ſenſe.</p>
               <p>And, How can they exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in Vertue, while ſuch anxious ſcruples, and confuſion, clowds their underſtanding, and caſts a damp upon all their vital faculties? Nay, this hath an immediate tendency to deſpair, for when they conſider themſelves uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of complying with ſuch a Maſs of Implex Articles of Faith, and conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own imbecility, they will be apt to conceive, that they are loſt, and that Eternity of Bliſs is out of their
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:101117:205"/>reach; for, <hi>qui erraverit in uno factus eſt omnium reus:</hi> he that errs in one, is made guilty of all; and hence they connaturally fall into deſperation.</p>
               <p>Beſides, What more hinders the Propagation of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then ſuch a multiplicity of Tenets, pretended ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Salvation, and yet ſo full of arduity, and ſo repugnant to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of Nature, which are apt to ſtartle the moſt credulous? Who would imbrace Chriſtianity, if ſuch a bundle of incredible Myſteries were candidly propoſed to them, as all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation? which are ſo deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the Laws of Nature; and no Proofes of any of them, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath defined them. Few or none would deny their Reaſon, and yield a blind conformity to ſuch, and ſo many irregular Pardons, as they ought to believe.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and many other ſuch incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, are the products of multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many new Articles of Faith, theſe are the fatal conſequences that thence enſue. And if you conſult your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to ſuggeſt to you, what benefit is hence expected, or what Motives might
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:101117:206"/>induce them, to impoſe ſo hard a taske upon the Believers: I know none, but a ſtrong propenſion in the Authors, to carry all things on, with a ſtrong hand, to make their Empire known, and to Lord it over the Flock of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be Objected, That the Illiterate ſhall not need to perplex themſelves, for they have a ſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to their Implicite Faith, by believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the Church believeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I Anſwer, That this is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deordinate and irregular point of Doctrine, to Teach them to regulate their Implicite Faith by the Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> as if this were a ſurer Rule to walk by, then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, the Practice, the Ordination, and Inſtitution of <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf. How hot doth this ſmell of Blaſphemy? to put ignorant Souls upon ſuch a prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way of Faith, as to prefer the Belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the Inſtitution of <hi>Christ,</hi> whereby the Faith of the Church ought to be ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally regulated.</p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:101117:206"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, If any Impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Faith be ſufficient after the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then the explicite declaration of ſo many Articles availeth nothing; for the very ſame Implicite Faith, that was ſufficient before the definition, is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent after; then the Councils labor in vain, or rather not in vain; for though their numerous definitions, produce no good effect, yet they have an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple power in producing bad effects, as hath been declared. And thus far I go with them, that in matters of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, an implicite in moſt caſes, is ſufficient to Salvation, provided it have a reference to that never erring Rule of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrine and Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, What <hi>Romaniſt</hi> dares deny this? For, I conſidently aſſert, That an Implicite Faith, regulated by the belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is not ſufficient to Salvation; for this Church hath erred, and may erre again, as is in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> ſufficiently declared, and proved.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew yet more groundedly, That the multiplying of ſo many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Faith, are wholly uſeleſs, and pernicious; let any rational perſon
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:101117:207"/>conſider, what ſtrange wonders the Supreme Creator of all things hath wrought, to bring about this great Work of Mans Redemption. The Divine Word took Humane Nature upon him, God became Man, and, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:101117:207"/>any perſon, indued with Reaſon, can conceive, that this Omniſcient, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and Infinitely Wiſe, and Provident God, ſhould be deficient, in a work of this Nature? that he ſhould leave this great work of our Redemption imperfect, that he ſhould fail in the compleat accompliſhment of his Maſter-piece? eſpecially conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that he could with eaſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide <hi>tunc pro nunc,</hi> he could then have provided for all future events, whenſoever they ſhould happen.</p>
               <p>And it is as impoſſible, that he ſhould leave any defects in a deſign of ſo high a nature, to be corrected, or ſupplyed by meer Men, that carry their human frailty and imperfections about them; for by this means, ſuch Men would be concauſes in the work of our Redemption; and yet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity never yet acknowledged any Redeemer but one.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, it is a high preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to attempt to compleat, or perfect <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s work, or to ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, which we falſely ſuppoſe he
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:101117:208"/>hath left in it. Nothing is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Reaſon, and nothing more derogates from the infinite Attributes, and high Prerogatives of our Great Redeemer.</p>
               <p>Whence I conclude with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma: Either <hi>Christ</hi> Inſtituted all things neceſſary to Salvation, or he did not. If not, What then became of all the Primitive Chriſtians, for Eight Hundred years together after <hi>Christ?</hi> for, in their time, none of thoſe new Doctrines, which are now defined, were yet ſtarted.</p>
               <p>Would <hi>Christ</hi> permit ſo many Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that were all Members of his Church, to periſh, for want of neceſſary means to Salvation? This would reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Author of Life, and make him a Deluder.</p>
               <p>They muſt therefore acknowledge, That <hi>Christ</hi> did Inſtitute in his Church all things neceſſary to Salvation. If ſo, Then what neceſſity is there of ſo many new definitions? which only ſerve to peſter and incumber Mens
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:101117:208"/>Minds; becauſe, forſooth, Eternal Damnation muſt be the reward of them, that deny any one of them, yea, or ſo much as doubt of the Truth of any them.</p>

               <p>THe Firſt Objection: According to the Principles of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, all Councils would be uſeleſs, or rather pernicious; for, the main deſign of Councils is, to decide ſuch doubts, as are promiſcuouſly diſcuſſed among the multitude, of whom (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Authority of a Council) none have power to give a final determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore Councils have been always in uſe: there was a Council in the Apoſtles time; there were ſeveral Councils in the <hi>Primitive Church.</hi> So that this Doctrine wholly ſwerves from Reaſon and Antiquity.</p>
               <p>The Firſt Anſwer: I am no Enemy of Councils, but on the contrary, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them of great uſe, and ſometimes neceſſary for the right Adminiſtration of the Church; for certainly many great and good effects depend upon
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:101117:209"/>them, when they take their meaſures right, and truly conceive how far the limits of their power and autority ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend. But if Councils tranſgreſs their bounds, and ſubmit <hi>Christ</hi>'s Actions to their ſcrutiny, and therein preſume to add or diminiſh, to alter or change, to correct or amend, any of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or Inſtitutions, and ſo intrench upon <hi>jus Divinum,</hi> which is above their ſphere; and in effect to cry out, <hi>in coelum conſcendam, ſimilis ero Altiſſimo:</hi> this is a pernicious abuſe of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority; wherefore,</p>
               <p>The Second Anſwer is; That when Vertue begins to decline, and Vice to abound; when the Clergy grows diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, and the Laity ſtubborn and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory againſt their Spiritual Leaders, and Paſtors; when the Doctrine and Practice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Primitive Chriſtians, is not fully upheld in its Original Purity, but begins to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſcated, and to loſe its efficacy, by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations, and in many other caſes of like nature, then are Councils both profitable and neceſſary, as a Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is to a ſick Patient; then ought they, by their opportune Remedies, to ſalve
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:101117:210"/>the Sores, to make up the breaches, to reforme the abuſes, and to redintegrate the whole body of the Church, and purge the Wheate, from the Cockle, and Darnel, which by the depraved will of Man, and the ſuggeſtion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, began to take root.</p>
               <p>But if Councils ſhould ſpend their endeavors, in debating certain abſtruſe, and hidden Myſteries, and frame Articles of Divine Faith upon them, without any warrant in Scripture, or Antiquity; nay, againſt the Original Belief of the Church; and by their annexed Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's drive Men to confuſion, and deſperation, and yet reap no benefit thereby; (for it neither promotes Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor curbs Vice, nor any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth to the inſtitution of a Moral and Chriſtian Life; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it puts Mens Conſciences upon the Rack, it diſturbs the peace and quiet of their Minds, it hinders their due application to Vertue and Morality, it perplexes their Souls with Scruples, and diſpoſeth them to deſpair. In this caſe, I appeal to the Judgment of the whole World, Whether the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:101117:210"/>of ſuch deciſions, be not fruitleſs and pernicious?</p>
               <p>To what is added in the Objection, I grant, that Councils have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in uſe, not to decide ſuch ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative points of Divinity, and reduce them to Articles of Faith, but to ſolve practical doubts, which may ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the vulgar, concerning their practiſe, and manners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may be inſtrumental to facilitate their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs towards Heaven; but as for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, it ought to be ſaid to them as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> That if an Angel ſhould come from Heaven, and Teach them otherwiſe then they had been Taught, by <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> they ought not to believe him, but <hi>let him be Accurſed,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9.</p>
               <p>The Second Objection: We are Taught by experience, that ſeveral <hi>Hereſiarchs</hi> have often attempted to make a breach in the Church, by their new Heterodox Doctrine; and the moſt efficacious remedy in the Church to prevent ſuch inconveniences, is to
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:101117:211"/>Anathematize the Authors, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn their Errors, as Heretical, which hath been alwayes practiſed in the Church with good ſucceſs, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating of Hereſie, and eſtabliſhing Orthodox Doctrine.</p>
               <p>To this Objection I Anſwer, <hi>First,</hi> That when the Definitions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils are grounded in Scripture, in the Doctrine and Practiſe of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> or otherwiſe by true Revelations made manifeſt, to be of Divine Autority, ſuch definitions are warrantable, and uſeful to extinguiſh Hereſie; but nothing of all this will quadrate with the forecited definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> which are no way proved by Autority, nor Reaſon; nay, rather they are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to both, yet are obtruded to the Credulous Believers, under a <hi>Curſe,</hi> to be by them received, by a blind aſſent, without examining the truth of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I Anſwer, That the moſt appoſite and efficacious way to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Hereſie, is to evince the Error
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:101117:211"/>of it, by ſolid and convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, drawn from Divine Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or evident Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Armes with which the Antient Fathers wag'd War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the reſpective Hereſies of their times: So St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> with his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſolid Principles, drew the great St. <hi>Augustine</hi> from his Hereſie, to imbrace the Orthodox Doctrine of <hi>Christianity;</hi> and the ſame <hi>Augustine</hi> being fully convinced thereof, with no leſs induſtry and zeal, then learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, efficaciouſly refelled the Errors of the <hi>Manichaeans,</hi> the <hi>Pellagians,</hi> the <hi>Maſſilienſes,</hi> the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> &amp;c. he alledged not the Autority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, but convinced the Broachers, and Abetters of thoſe Errors, with ſolid Arguments, whereby he detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Fallacy of their irregular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets: And ſo by Divine Autority, and ſtrength of Reaſon, refelled their illegal Aſſertions.</p>
               <pb n="398" facs="tcp:101117:212"/>
               <p>The Reaſon of this proceeding is manifeſt; for the firſt Authors of ſuch Erroneous Doctrines, and they who greedily give their aſſent to them, make it their buſineſs to maintain them againſt all oppoſition, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their undertakings, hugging their Errors, as the happy products of their own underſtanding, whence they ſo tenaciouſly adhere to them, that no Curſe, nor Cenſure, can make any impreſſion upon them.</p>
               <p>If you cite the Definitions of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils againſt them, they alledge their Reaſons againſt you, and Challenge you to Solve them.</p>
               <p>How earneſtly did <hi>Nestorius</hi> inſiſt, upon the Force of his Argument, to prove two Perſons in <hi>Chriſt?</hi> And the whole ſtreſs of his Proofe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this one <hi>Sillogiſme:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Omnis Natura Rationalis Completa est Perſona; ſed in Christo ſunt duae Rationales Naturae completae; ergo duae Perſonae.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="399" facs="tcp:101117:212"/>
               <p>In <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus:</p>
               <p>All Compleat Rational Natures are Perſons; but, in <hi>Christ,</hi> there are two compleat Rational Natures; <hi>ergo,</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> there are two Perſons.</p>
               <p>With this <hi>Argument Nestorius</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext the <hi>Fathers,</hi> whereof none durſt deny either of the Premiſes, and yet the Concluſion was Erroneous. And certainly <hi>Neſtorius</hi> would have ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any definition of a Council, againſt his Aſſertion, without ſolving his Argument.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, the moſt efficacious way to Refute an Heretick, is to Inſtruct his Reaſon, and Convince his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his Principles are Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; to this end Arguments are to be drawn from Scripture and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority, ſeconded by cleer and evident Reaſon, and from theſe two Premiſes you may infer a concluſion contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to the Error.</p>
               <p>And hereby you encreaſe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Adheſion to his Error: for
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:101117:213"/>there are none ſo obſtinate as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that which is eſtabliſht by known Divine Autority, and Evident Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. V.</hi> When, and from whom this Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> took its firſt riſe?</head>
               <p>ALl Dogmatical Aſſertions, which are pretended to be matters of Divine Faith, if they be ſo, its rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly neceſſary that they be backt by Divine Autority, and therefore muſt be traced immediately from <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; or elſe atteſted by thoſe Hagyog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphers, the old <hi>Prophets, Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. who were immediately inſpired by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo could not erre; by whoſe Mediation it muſt <hi>ultimate</hi> be reſolved into Divine Autority.</p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe all acts of Divine Faith conſiſt eſſentially of two parts; the Material and the Formal Object; the Material Object is the thing believed: the Formal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is <hi>dictio Dei,</hi> Gods ſaying it, which is the only motive that induceth us to believe it, as Divine Faith. And herein Faith differs from Science, and
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:101117:214"/>Opinion, becauſe Science, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with certainty, yet derives it from the evidence of Human Reaſon, which is inductive to the aſſent. Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath neither certainty, nor evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but a meer probability, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a weak foundation of Reaſon, <hi>cum formidine partis oppoſitae;</hi> it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accompanyed with an ambiguity, either formal, or virtual, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may be true: But Faith, if it be Divine, relyes upon Divine Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; if Human, on Human Authority. For inſtance; we believe that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word is Incarnate, becauſe God hath aſſured it; this is an act of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith, whoſe material Object, is the Incarnation of the Divine Word. The formal Object, is Gods aſſerting of it.</p>
               <p>Whence it enſues, that though Faith have a greater certainty then Science, yet it is deſtitute of Evidence, as well <hi>in atteſtato,</hi> as <hi>in attestante,</hi> that is, can neither demonſtrate by Human Reaſon, the Revelation it ſelf, nor the Myſtery revealed.</p>
               <p>We all agree, that thoſe words, <hi>Hoc est corpus menm,</hi> were ſpoken by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: But we differ in giving
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:101117:214"/>the true ſenſe and meaning of them. The ſureſt Rule that may guide us herein, is to conſult the Belief of the Primitive Church, they certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the <hi>Apostles</hi> the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of them. For it would derogate from <hi>Christ</hi>'s goodneſs, and providence, to imprint an erroneous belief, upon the firſt Profeſſors of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</hi> What then remains? but that we conſult Antiquity, and inquire what their beliefe was of this Myſtery. And when this appears, it would be a vain attempt of any one, after a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeries of Centuries, to ſtart a new Interpretation of thoſe words, for that muſt needs be an Erroneous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, and Adulterated Doctrine, as repugnant to the general belief of all Chriſtians from <hi>Christ</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>I ſhould ſwerve from my intended brevity, ſhould I here cite the ſeveral Texts of the antient Fathers, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Church, in oppoſition to the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> for, ſpeaking of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> they frequently call it the Sacrement of the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ;</hi> and St. <hi>Augustine</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Aug. de Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Dei L. <hi>10.</hi> C. <hi>5.</hi>
                  </note> That a Sacrament ſignifies a Sacred Sign, which cannot be the thing ſignified. They
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:101117:215"/>alſo call it the Reſemblance, the Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, the Type, the Antitype; the Symbole, the Sign, the Image, the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and conſequently not the Body it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Conſonant to theſe expreſſions of the Fathers, was the Univerſal Belief of the Church, none poſitively affirming for above 800 years after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that the Body of our Saviour was really contained in the Sacrament; Though in the year 637, A Monk of <hi>Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> one <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> among other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations which he had in his Cell, would needs diſapprove of the former way of ſpeaking, which had been ever uſed till his time, and ſo rejected the expreſſion of <hi>Figure,</hi> and <hi>Antitype;</hi> but uſed no attempt to ſettle any point of Doctrine, repugnant to the belief of Antiquity.</p>
               <p>Yet, what <hi>Anastaſius</hi> began, by way of altering the Tearms, another Monk of <hi>Corbie</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> one <hi>Paſchaſius Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> compleating by his Doctrine, Taught, That the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were truly and really preſent in the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:101117:215"/>he declares in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the Body and Blood of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> which he Compoſed in the Ninth Century after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the year 818. And for this we have <hi>Bellarmines</hi> own Teſtimony,<note place="margin">Bellarm. de Script. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</note> who acknowledgeth, that <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> was the firſt Author that ever Wrote a ſerious Treatiſe of the Truth of the Body and Blood of our <hi>Saviour</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine being then new, (ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any before attempting to aſſert it by any ſet <hi>Treatiſe</hi>) it found great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; ſo that moſt of the Learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Men in thoſe times, employed their endeavors, ſeverally, to oppoſe it, and cry it down; which <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acknowledgeth; for being moved by his intimate Friend <hi>Frudegard,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Paſchaſias Epiſt ad Frudegard. Pag. <hi>623.</hi>
                  </note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Doctrine; he Anſwers him; You queſtion me about a difficulty, whereof many People do doubt (to wit, of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi>) ſo in his Letter to <hi>Frudegard.</hi> And in his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary</hi> upon the 26th of St. <hi>Mark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Idem. in <hi>26</hi> Matth. L. <hi>12.</hi> pag. <hi>1094.</hi>
                  </note> he ſays, I have Treated of theſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries more amply and expreſly, becauſe I have been informed that I have been Cenſured by many; as if in the Book which I Wrote of the Sacrament, and
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:101117:216"/>Publiſhed, I had attributed to the words of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> more then the truth of the words would permit.</p>
               <p>This being a thing ſo well known in Hiſtory, I ſhall not here inlarge upon it; but only reflect upon the Doctrine of one of our own Nation, which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable <hi>Bede,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bede in Luc. C. <hi>22.</hi> Idem in Pſ. <hi>3.</hi> Idem hom. de Sanc. in Epiph. Idem. in Pſ. <hi>133.</hi> To. <hi>8.</hi> Idem de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hern. L. <hi>2.</hi> C. <hi>2.</hi> &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibi.</note> who, in ſeveral places of his Works, declares his Opinion againſt the <hi>Real Preſence;</hi> for he tells us, That our Saviour hath given us the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Body and Blood in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Bread and Wine. And that our Saviour gave to his Diſciples, in the Laſt Supper, the Figure of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood. That the Creatures of Bread and Wine paſs into the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Body and Blood, by the ineffable Sactification of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi> That our Saviour changed the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Legalia</hi> into the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine. And that in lieu of celebrating the Paſſion of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the Fleſh and the Blood of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctims, as the Antients did, we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate it in the Oblation of Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>Theſe, and the like expreſſions, (which are frequent in the Works of this Author) do manifeſtly declare,
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:101117:216"/>that in thoſe times, none held the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> but all believed the <hi>Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist</hi> to be a Figure, or a Sacrament, (that is, a Sign) of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence there aroſe in the Church a high debate about this new Doctrine; <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> got ſome Abetters of his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; but the greateſt number, and the moſt conſiderable, vehemently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, as a Novelty; others ſtood indifferent, expecting the iſſue; others again held a third Opinion, which, in ſubſtance, was <hi>Conſubstantiation;</hi> for they Aſſerted, The Body of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> to be united to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread. The conteſt about theſe ſeveral Opinions grew fervent, ſome adhering to the one part, others to the other: and this mutual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt laſted all the Ninth Century. Whereupon that Great Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> Surnamed <hi>the Balde,</hi> who was then Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> and King of <hi>France,</hi> finding his Subjects diſſected into oppoſite Parties, and contending againſt each other, with ſo much rancor and animoſity, reſolved to Conſult the Learnedſt Men he had in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon the Queſtion, which was
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:101117:217"/>the ground of the debate. Purſuant to this Reſolution, he calls to him one <hi>John Scot,</hi> whoſe right Name was <hi>Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene,</hi> by Nation an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> or a <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> I am not certain which; This was a perſon of profound Learning, and eminent Vertue, and therefore highly eſteemed by the Emperor, and was vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called, The <hi>Holy Philoſopher.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, which the Emperor deſigned for his intended purpoſe, was one <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> but, by the Writers of his time, was called <hi>Retram,</hi> which was his true Name. He was a Monk and Prieſt of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Corbie;</hi> and afterwards, for his Fame, and rare Parts, was created Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Orbais,</hi> who Wrote ſeveral Books; and among others, one of <hi>Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> againſt <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> whom he Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly impugnes, and cenſures him of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie. He was of the moſt eminent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute of his time. He was a great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent of all Novelty, and Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and, for his Merits, very dear to the Emperor.</p>
               <p>Theſe then were the Perſons which the Emperor conſulted, and required them, to give him in Writing, the True Senſe of the <hi>Church,</hi> concerning the Body
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:101117:217"/>of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> Whether it were contained in the Sacrament, in Verity and Reality, or only in Vertue and Figure? as alſo, whether it were the ſame Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was born of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> Suffered upon the Croſs, Roſe from the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we receive in the Sacrament; for, to both Queſtions, <hi>Paſchaſius</hi> Anſwers, That it was the ſame Body preſent in the <hi>Eucharist</hi> in Verity, and Reality, and not only in Vertue and Figure.</p>
               <p>To theſe two Queſtions, the forenamed Doctors gave in their Anſwer in <hi>Latin</hi> to the Emperor in Writing, and their Reſolutions were contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> as to both Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For, to the <hi>First,</hi> Whether that which we receive in the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> be truly and really the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or only a Figure and Type thereof? They both Anſwer, That the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are contained in this Sacrament only in Figure and Virtue, and not in Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As to the <hi>Second</hi> Queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the ſame Body that was Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſuffered on the Croſs, that was Buried, and Roſe again, that Aſcended into Heaven?
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:101117:218"/>they Anſwer, That we Receive the Figure and Verture of that ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>And not wholly to omit the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions of theſe two Doctors. I ſhall here briefly relate ſome paſſages of each of them.</p>

               <p>THis Learned Doctor, how dear ſoever he was to that Great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Charles;</hi> yet he was ſharply cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, and ſeverely handled, by ſeveral <hi>Authors,</hi> and great Prelates, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Council of <hi>Valentia,</hi> for ſome Dogmatical Points, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> that he Wrote, of <hi>Predestination,</hi> and the ſtate of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Life, as deviating from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Principles of the Church; yet none reprehended him for his Doctrine of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> And certainly he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritted eternal renown for Tranſlating the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Dionyſius</hi> of <hi>Areopagyta,</hi> from <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> by Command of the Emperor <hi>Charles,</hi> which Work added no ſmall acceſs to the Opinion formerly conceived of his zeal, and eloquence, for hence he was eſteemed a Saint, and that his Doctrine and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was infus'd from Heaven.</p>

               <p>His Fame daily increaſing, he was at laſt called into <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Alfrede,</hi> then King, where he was Barbarouſly Murdered by his own Diſciples, in the Monaſtery of <hi>Malmeſbury,</hi> in the year 883, or thereabouts, and was decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buried in that Church; but his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was afterwards, with great Pomp, and Magnificence, tranſlated to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral, and there placed before the Altar, with this <hi>Epitaph, Here lies</hi> John <hi>the Holy Philoſopher,</hi>

                  <hi>who in his life time was inriched with wonderful Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and in the end had the honor to aſcend by Martyrdom to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>where the Saints reign eternally:</hi> as <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> relates. And after his deceaſe, by the Autority of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was put into the Catalogue of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. His <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained extant about 200 years after he Wrote it, by the Emperors Command; but about the year 1050, it was read in the Council of <hi>Verceils,</hi> where Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth preſided, and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be Burnt, as being repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Orthodox Doctrine of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> which was accordingly put in execution; and ſo this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:101117:219"/>And conſequently it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten moved to have him expunged from the Catalogue of Saints, but without effect, till the time of <hi>Baronius,</hi> who, alledging, That he had Written againſt the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> upon this account, got him excluded from that rank wherein he had been formerly placed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th, and other Popes,<note place="margin">Hiſtor.

                  <hi>SECT. VII.</hi> Some Paſſages of the Life and Doctrine of <hi>Retram.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THis Doctor was one of the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedſt, and of the faireſt repute of his time; and, upon this account, was choſen among the reſt, by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor, together with <hi>John Scot,</hi> or <hi>Erigéne,</hi> to give him an account, what was the true meaning of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Word's, and the true Doctrine of the Church, in relation to the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> By this means, to allay the heat of that turbulent Contention, and Animoſity, which had reacht the utmoſt confines of his Dominions, and diſſected his Subjects into violent Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, occaſioned by the Writings of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſius,</hi> wherein he Aſſerted the <hi>Real Preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe two great Men, in Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Emperors Command, gave
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:101117:220"/>their Anſwer in two diſtinct <hi>Treatiſes,</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> upon this Subject, wherein they both agreed, that the true Orthodox Doctrine, never admitted of any <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the Sacrament, but that it was there contained Virtually, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively, by means of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which they proved out of the Scripture, and Fathers, alleging ſeveral parallel examples out of Holy Writ: concluding, that the adverſe Opinion was a Heterodox novelty, contrary to Scripture, Fathers, and the Univerſal Belief of the Church, till that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Retram,</hi> when he Wrote this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> was a Prieſt of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Monck of the Monaſtery of <hi>Corby:</hi> ſoon after, there aroſe great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, between <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, then Pope, and <hi>Photius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople;</hi> whereupon, Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> implores the Aſſiſtance of the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> to defend the <hi>Latin</hi> Church againſt the <hi>Greeks.</hi> The Clergy of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church knew not where to find a more able, and expert Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to carry on this great deſign, then <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Retram,</hi> and ſo unanimouſly choſe him to defend the Pope, and the
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:101117:221"/>
                  <hi>Latin</hi> Church, againſt their Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts. <hi>Retram</hi> undertakes it, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges his truſt with a great deal of honor, and applauſe, and was afterwards created Abbot of <hi>Orbais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come to his Doctrine, his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> was providently preſerved, and at length Tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Printed here in <hi>England,</hi> about a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thirty and two years ſince, in the year of our Lord 1549, whereof there have been ſeveral Editions ſince, and it was lately Printed in <hi>France,</hi> both in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> But now come we to give you a Specimen of the Tenets which by this Treatiſe he endeavors to eſtabliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, he tells us, <hi>That the Bread, which by the Myſtery of the Prieſt, is made the Body of Christ, doth ſhew one thing to the External Senſes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing ſoundeth inwardly to the Mind of Faith. Outwardly the Bread remaineth as it was before,</hi> &amp;c. and then he adds of the VVine; <hi>The Wine alſo, which by the Conſecration of the Prieſt, is made the Sacrament of the Blood of Christ,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What other thing is ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:101117:221"/>looked upon but the ſubſtance of Wine?</hi> VVhere he affirms the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and VVine to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Sacrament after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration. To this he ſubjoyns: <hi>For notwithſtanding that after the Mystical Conſecration, Bread is not called Bread, nor the Wine, Wine, but the Body and Blood of Chriſt; yet after that which is ſeen, neither is any kind of Fleſh known in the Bread, nor in the Wine any drop of Blood.</hi> Before, he told us, that the Bread and VVine remained in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after Conſecration, as they were before; now he tells us, That after Conſecration, there is not any kind of Fleſh, nor one drop of Blood, <hi>though the Bread be not called Bread, nor the Wine, Wine, but the Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> where he granteth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> but denyeth the verity and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance thereof; for he acknowledgeth nothing but the Bread and VVine, though they be not called ſo. This in ſubſtance he often repeateth, <hi>for after the verity</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the kind of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which was before, is known ſtill to remain.</hi> VVhat more conſpicuous?</p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:101117:222"/>
               <p>Then addreſſing his Diſcourſe to his Adverſaries, he tells them, <hi>That under the veile of Corporeal Bread and Wine, is the Spiritual Body and Blood of Christ.</hi> So that the Bread and VVine remain Corporeally, but the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> Spiritually, by their vertue of Sanctification. And then preſently, compares this Sacrament to <hi>Holy Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> wherein the natural Element of VVater, which of it ſelf hath only power to waſh and cleanſe the Body, yet by <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution is impowered to cleanſe and ſanctifie the Soul, and yet ſtill remains the Natural Element of VVater, ſubject to corruption; and then applyes the VVater in <hi>Baptiſme</hi> to the Bread and VVine in the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Hence he proceeds to another ſimilitude, telling them, <hi>That the Fathers of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were Baptiſed in the Cloud, and in the Sea,</hi> which produced a Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al effect, and yet ſuffered no Mutation: This again he parallelleth to the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper. Then he tells them, <hi>Likewiſe Manna given to the People from Heaven, and the Water flowing out of the Rock, were Corporeal, and Corporeally they fed the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:101117:222"/>and gave them drink; yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle nameth that Manna, and that Water, Spiritual Meat, and Spiritual Drink;</hi> and then he applyeth it to the Bread, and Wine, as before, which takes off all ambiguity of his meaning, for he drives at this, that the Bread and VVine, which remain in the Sacrament, though Natural, and Corporeal things, yet by the powerful operation of <hi>Christ,</hi> they are enabled, to produce in the Souls of the worthy Receivers, the ſame Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Grace, and Sanctification, as if the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ</hi> were there really preſent; and therefore the Bread and Wine are called the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeds farther, ſaying, <hi>Here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we ought to conſider what is meant by theſe words, except you ſhall eate the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and Drink his Blood, you ſhall have no life in you. He ſaid not, That his Fleſh which hanged on the Croſs, ſhould be eaten in pieces, and eaten of the Apostles; nor that his Blood which he ſhed for the Redemption of the World ſhould be given his Diſciples to drink; for it were a wicked thing, if his Fleſh ſhould be eaten, and his Blood drunk, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels took it.</hi> And to confirm this, he
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:101117:223"/>cites St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> upon the ſame Text of Scripture,<note place="margin">Aug. de Dodr. Chriſt. L. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s commands, in theſe words. <hi>He ſeemeth to command a wicked thing; therefore it is a Figure,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus St.</hi> Auguſtine <hi>affirmeth the Mystery of the Body and Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>to be celebrated of the Faithful, under a Figure; for he ſaith, It is no point of Religion, but rather of Iniquity, to take his Fleſh, and his Blood, as they did, which understood not</hi> Chriſt<hi>'s words Spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but Carnally, and went back.</hi> Then he gives many examples in other like caſes, to ſhew, Why the Bread and Wine are called the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> becauſe of the Similitude they have with the things Signified, and ſo concludeth: <hi>Wherefore the Myſteries be named, the Body and Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>becauſe they take the appellation of things, whereof they be Sacraments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he cites ſeveral paſſages out of St. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> to confirm the ſame Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; of whom he ſaith, <hi>Afterwards he declareth, what Sacraments are to be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated among the Faithful; that is, the Sacrament of Baptiſme, and of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of</hi> Chriſt. And here I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to take notice, by the way, that for above Eight hundred
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:101117:223"/>years after <hi>Christ,</hi> there were but theſe Two Sacraments acknowledged in the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> and conſequently no more were Inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. Yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Five more, which Antiquity ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, under the notion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Is it credible, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould Inſtitute for his Church Seven Sacraments, and yet communicate to the firſt Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and their Succeſſors, for Eight Centuries, the knowledge only of Two of them? This cannot be. The other Five were therefore Inſtituted by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> names Seven, and makes it an Article of Faith to believe them all Sacraments, and layes its Curſe upon the Disbelievers. <hi>Si quis dixerit Sacramenta novae legis,</hi>

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:101117:224"/>What judgment can we here frame? Examine Antiquity for Eight or Nine hundred years after <hi>Christ,</hi> that can give us no Intelligence of any more then Two Sacraments, and yet the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſtrictly commands the belief of Seven. Certainly the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of that Church muſt have recourſe to their blind obedience, to ſubmit to ſuch Canons and Decrees as theſe. For if <hi>Chriſt</hi> did not Inſtitute thoſe Five pretended Sacraments, (as it is plain he did not) then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> muſt have attempted to inſtitute them, not by appointing the matter, but by giving them the vertue of Sacraments, which is highly preſumptive, and a manifeſt violation of <hi>Divine Right;</hi> for none but <hi>Chriſt</hi> can ordain the means, and the vehicles, whereby he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to convey his Spiritual Graces (which were the fruits of his Paſſion) to the Souls of the Faithful; this is his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Prerogative. But this being a digreſſion from the matter in hand, I deſiſt, and leave it to the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bertram</hi> now draws to the cloſe of his Firſt <hi>Question,</hi> Whether the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be contained in the
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:101117:224"/>Holy Sacrament in Verity, or in Figure? and concludes with theſe words, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have we declared, that the Body and Blood of Christ, which are received in the Church, by the mouths of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, be Figures.</hi> And ſo terminates this Firſt <hi>Queſtion.</hi>

               <p>THe Second <hi>Question</hi> that was to be reſolved by <hi>Retram,</hi> or <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram,</hi> was this, as he himſelf declares, <hi>Whether the ſame Body that was Born of</hi> Mary, <hi>that Suffered, Dyed, was Buried, and ſitteth on the Right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, be that Body which is daily received in the Church, by the mouths of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in the Mystery of the Sacrament, or no?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ambr. L. <hi>1</hi> de Sacram.</note> And firſt he diſcourſeth out of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> That the ſubſtance of the Creatures ſuffer no Mutation, in theſe words, <hi>For after the ſubſtance of the Creatures, they be even the ſame things after the Conſecration, that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For before the Conſecration, they were Bread, and Wine, and after they appear to remain in the ſame kind ſtill.</hi> Where his Poſition is, That the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Creatures are the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conſecration, that they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which he proves thus; Before Conſecration, they were Bread and
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:101117:225"/>Wine, and after Conſecration, they not only appear to remain, but really do remain, in the ſame kind, ſtill of Bread and Wine; this muſt be the drift of his Argument, for elſe it would not prove his intent.</p>
               <p>Then having ſaid, <hi>That the Body and Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>are not preſent in forme, but in vertue;</hi> he applauds a diſtinction of St. <hi>Ambroſe: How dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and how wiſely hath he made a distinction, where be ſaith, touching the fleſh which was Cruciſied, and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: this is the true Fleſh of</hi> Chriſt; <hi>but touching that which is received in the Sacrament, he ſaith, This is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the true Fleſh; ſo dividing the Sacrament of the Fleſh, from the very Fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But he affirmeth the Myſtery which is done in the Church, to be the Sacrament of the very Fleſh, in which</hi> Chriſt <hi>Suffered, inſtructing the Faithful, that the Fleſh in which</hi> Chriſt <hi>Suffered, and was Crucified and Buried, is not a Myſtery, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Natural Fleſh; but this Fleſh which now containeth the Similitude of the very Fleſh in Myſtery, is not Fleſh in Kind, nor in Forme, but in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <hi>The Fleſh and the Blood of</hi> Chriſt (ſaith he, St. <hi>Hierom</hi>) <hi>are underſtood two manner of ways;</hi> which he explicates, the one Corporeally, and the other Spiritually. <hi>Therefore</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bertram</hi>) <hi>the Spiritual Fleſh, and the Spiritual Blood, which are daily receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Faithful, do differ undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Fleſh Crucified, and the Blood ſhed, as the Autority of this Doctor doth witneſs.</hi> Much to this purpoſe he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth upon the Autority of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. in Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Sancti Joan.</note> diſtinguiſhing between the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food and the Corporeal Food of the Fathers of the Old Law, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them with us. Where he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, out of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that their Spiritual Food was the ſame with ours, the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the Corporeal Food was very different, as much as the Manna, the Cloud, and the Sea differ from Bread and Wine: Which he confirms by the Autority of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the Antient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that were Baptiſed in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, and they all did eate the ſame Spiritual Meate, and drank the ſame Spiritual Drink, which he concludes to be <hi>Christ</hi> in a
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:101117:226"/>Figure, as it is with us in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, in a certain manner, and <hi>this manner is in Figure and Image.</hi> Hence he draws this Illation; <hi>Wherefore the Body and Blood, that we now celebrate in the Church, do differ from the Body, and the Blood, which are now known to be glorified by the Reſurrection; This Body is the Pledge, and the Figure, the other is the very Natural Body.</hi> And pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he adds, <hi>And as the Figure dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth from the verity, thus it is plain, that the Myſtery of the Body and Blood of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>which is received of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in the Church, differeth from the ſaid Body, that was Born of</hi> Mary <hi>the Virgin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Then he cites St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s words, Preaching to the People of the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ. The thing which you ſee in the Altar of God</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Austin</hi>) <hi>was ſeen of you the laſt night;</hi>

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:101117:227"/>they ought to believe, the Bread to be the Body, and the Wine to be the Blood of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And then he makes them object, that the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that was Born of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. with his Blood, Aſcended entirely into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where he now is; How then can this Bread be his Body, and this Wine his Blood? St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> Anſwers, <hi>Theſe, good Brethren, be called Sacraments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that one thing is ſeen in them, and another thing understood; that which is ſeen, hath a Corporeal form, and that which is not ſeen hath a Spiritual Fruit.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Bertram</hi> adds, <hi>In theſe words, this worſhipful Author instructing us, what we ought to think of the proper Body of the Lord, that was Born of</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>&amp;c. Alſo what we ought to think of the Body ſet on the Altar, whereof the People be partakers. The very Body is whole, and not divided with any Section, neither co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with any Figures; but this Body ſet on the Table of the Lord, is a Figure, becauſe it is a Sacrament.</hi> And again, <hi>Therefore St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>hath Taught us, that as the Body of</hi> Chriſt <hi>is ſignified in the Bread, which is on the Altar, ſo is the Body of the People that receive it.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="429" facs="tcp:101117:227"/>
               <p>Then Addreſſing his Diſcoure to the Emperor, he ſaith, <hi>Your Wiſdom (moſt excellent Prince) may perceive, that I have proved, by the Teſtimonies of Holy Scripture, and of the Holy Fathers, that the Bread which is called the Body of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and the Cup called his Blood, is a Figure, becauſe it is a Mystery. And that there is no ſmall difference between the Myſtical Body, and the Body that Suffered, was Buried, and Roſe again; for this which ſuffered, is the proper Body of our Saviour; neither in it is any Figure, or Signification, but the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt action of the thing it ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus he concludes his Anſwer to the Emperor, inſiſting all along up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Truth, That in this Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is contained the ſame Bread, and Wine, that was before, which are called the Body and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they Myſtically, and Figuratively, ſignifie the ſame, and are Received by the Faithful, by way of <hi>Commemoration</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Paſſion, and by vertue of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution, they Sanctifie the Receiver; but ſtill denies, that the True Body and Blood
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:101117:228"/>of <hi>Christ,</hi> which was Born of the <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary,</hi> Suffered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in <hi>Verity,</hi> or <hi>Reality,</hi> preſent in this Sacrament, but only Figuratively, and Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>

               <p>WE have ſeen the Opinion of thoſe Two Champions of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> which were Conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor. To whom I might add many more Abbots, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and Archbiſhops, and the moſt eminent Perſons of thoſe times, for Learning and Vertue, but this would be too prolix, and contrary to my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>But, in the Firſt place let us reflect, that after <hi>Retram</hi> had Written his <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe</hi> of the Body and Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> How all the Biſhops and Prelates of <hi>France,</hi> could precedently elect him, in a matter of ſo great conſequence, to defend the <hi>Latin</hi> Church againſt the Pretenſions of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and rely chiefly upon his management of it? Eſpecially ſince Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt (who had excited them to this Debate)
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:101117:229"/>approved of their Choice; for, had they found any flaw in his Doctrine, as not conformable to the Antient Belief of the Church, they might with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have ſuſpected, that he might have vented ſome other error in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes with the <hi>Greeck</hi> Church, which would utterly have ruin'd their Cauſe. But no ſuch thing was ſurmis'd of him, nor objected againſt him: whence we may certainly infer, That all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Prelates of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, yea, and the Pope alſo, were of his Opinion in the Doctrine of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> To this we may add, That Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second (who alſo Govern'd the Church, during this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate) never oppoſed himſelf againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Retram,</hi> nor never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him for it, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, he ought to have done, had he deem'd it any way Heterodox.<note place="margin">Gratian. in in Decret. dist. <hi>82.</hi> C. Error.</note> For, as <hi>Gratian</hi> tells us, <hi>He approves an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which he doth not oppoſe:</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if by his Office he ought to do it. And becauſe during this Ninth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, there were ſo few that adher'd to the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very inconſiderable, and like to dye of it ſelf, for want of ſupport, and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:101117:229"/>therefore was prudently not reflected upon. Whence we may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the General Belief of the Church, till almoſt Nine Hundred years after <hi>Christ,</hi> was conformable to the Doctrine of <hi>Retram,</hi> and of <hi>John Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>géne,</hi> who denyed the Exiſtence of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body and Blood, in the Holy Sacrament, in Verity and Reality; and admitted it Virtually, Figuratively, and by way of a Sacrament. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief maugre all the Anathemaes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is lineally deſcended from <hi>Christ,</hi> and his Apoſtles, to theſe our times, and is the general perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conformable to the Nine and Thirty Articles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seconly,</hi> Conſider, which of theſe two Dogmatical Aſſertions is moſt like to be the genuine and legitimate off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of <hi>Christ,</hi> either that which drew his Origine immediately from <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, and hath kept poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ever ſince; or the other, that was not ſtarted till Eight Hundred years after, and knows no other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitor but <hi>Paſchaſius?</hi> The firſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly will appear to the unbiaſſed judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:101117:230"/>of all, to be Legitimate; and the ſecond Spurious, and Adulterate.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Here is yet a higher Point, which preſents it ſelf to our conſideration. We all believe that the Divine Word, purſuant to his efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Decree, became Incarnate chiefly for this end, That, in Human Nature, he might Redeem Mankind; he accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this end, by a cruel Death, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Indignities, which he ſuffered, and thereby fatisfied for our Tranſgreſſions, and Merited for us an infinite Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Graces; and to the end that Mankind might participate of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable benefit, for all future ages, he inſtituted a Church, ordained Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to convey thoſe Graces to our Souls. He Inſtructed thoſe, that were to initiate his Church, in his Divine Doctrine; he gave them his Heavenly Precepts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whence I appeal to the impartial and unbyaſſed judgments, both of Men and Angels, whether it be probable, or credible, that this Supreme Artificer inſtructed with all his infinite Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of an illimited Knowledge,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:101117:230"/>Power, Wiſdom, Providence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould leave this great Work of our Redemption (which was his Maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece) imperfect, and incompleat; yea, contaminated with groſs Errors, and Hereſies, in its firſt Foundation, in a matter of ſuch high moment, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his moſt Sacred Body, and Blood, and was deſtructive of the Eſſentials, of one of thoſe two Sacraments, which he had ordain'd, and the Principal for Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and permit its progreſs in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Doctrine, for Eight Hundred years together, which would have had a direct tendency to confuſion, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, to the utter ruine and diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Church, and ſo fruſtrate the final end of his Incarnation? And that after ſo many Centuries, one <hi>Paſchaſius Rathert,</hi> a Monk, ſhould ſtart up from his Cell, and pretend to Correct this Error, and hereby to perfect and amend the work of the Omnipotent, as if <hi>Christ</hi> would not, or could not have done it of himſelf. Is this, I ſay, credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? or, Would it not highly dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from the Dignity of the Divine Perſon, and the infinite Attributes of our great. Lord and Maſter? What then muſt we conclude? But that this
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:101117:231"/>belief of the Body, and Blood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which took its Origine from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Inſtitution of Chriſtianity, was True, Orthodox, and Catholick Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; ſo that <hi>Christ</hi> accompliſht the deſign which he had undertaken, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly and compleatly, and ſo remitted it to Poſterity, without either ſpot or blemiſh.</p>
               <p>And if you deſire Preſidents, do but caſt a compendious glance, upon all the former products of the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent hand of God. The Frame of this Univerſe was Projected and Created by God himſelf, who having produc't it, he ſaw that it was very good; that is, perfect, and compleat. He Created the Angels, with all the Natural Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections due to the excellency of their Nature; no accompliſhment was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and moreover, in their firſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, imbued them with Supernatural Grace, and gave them a Title to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>Simul in eis condens naturam,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. l. <hi>12.</hi> de Civit. C. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>&amp; largiens gratiam,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Austin.</hi> The ſame ſaith St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> in his Morals, and others. Man was likewiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't in his full perfection, and his Soul, in its firſt Creation, was imbelliſht with
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:101117:231"/>Sactifying Grace, and Original Juſtice. The Superior Orbes were Created, and placed in their reſpective Sphears, with all the Accompliſhment of Perfection proper to their Nature, with due Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination, conducing to the good and perſervation of the Univerſe; their Natural Motion was imprinted into them in their firſt Creation, which ſtill remains immutable, though probably their rapt motion be regulated by the Miniſtery of Angels. And in this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary World, there is not one Species, but in its firſt being, received all the Perfections, which were appropriated to its kind. So that all the Works of God were perfect and compleat; though ſome of the Angels, and the Firſt Man <hi>Adam,</hi> which were Created free, fell from the happy State they were Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in, by the perverſe uſe of their Free-wills.</p>
               <p>Who then ſhall dare preſume, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe the Laſt Work of the Incarnate Word, with any Pretended Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and render it Heterogeneal from the reſt? For he is the ſame Omnipotent God, that Created all thoſe things mentioned, and his Power is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg'd, nor his Will Chang'd; for
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:101117:232"/>he is Eſſentially uncapable of any Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Mutation, or Imperfection. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains therefore, that the Opinion of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> Teaching, the Real Exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Body and Blood in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> was a New, Heterodox, and Erroneous Doctrine, diſcrepating from the conſtant Belief of the Church, from the begining till that time.</p>
               <p>And hence is evinced the falſity of that Erroneous Doctrine, that aſſerts the Literal, and Oral Manducation of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Gloriſied Body in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for if that Glorified Body be not Actually, Really, Phyſically, and Locally preſent in the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> then the Receiver cannot exerciſe any ſuch Oral Manducation of it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Poſition is repugnant to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority of Scripture, and Fathers; it is againſt Antiquity, and Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was once Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate, and retain'd its Original Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency for many years. But, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, though perfect in their Creation, yet by their Swelling Thoughts, Aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Sublimer Prerogatives, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:101117:232"/>to their Limited Perfections, fell from that happy State of their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Creation; ſo the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when many high and Soaring Spirits met together in Councils, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon their Pretended Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Uſurpt a Power of Swaying all things belonging to the Church, and Religion, according to their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; then they began to Abrogate ſome things of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Inſtitution, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce others of their own; they made ſeveral Commutations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, exceeding the limits of their Power, as hath been proved in this <hi>Treatiſe:</hi> So that now their Church is like a confus'd <hi>Chaos,</hi> retaining ſome things of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Inſtitution, commixt with others of their own Human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and ſo have loſt that Purity and Perfection, which once they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd; And which the Proteſtant Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtill retains in its Primitive and Original Purity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</p>
               <p>And here I cloſe up this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> wherein, whatſoever I have delivered, I humbly ſubmit to
